       " 'ghana, officially the republic of ghana, is a country in west africa.[9] it abuts the gulf of guinea and the atlantic ocean to the south, sharing borders with ivory coast in the west, burkina faso in the north, and togo in the east.[10] ghana covers an area of 239,535 km2 (92,485 sq mi),[4] spanning diverse biomes that range from coastal savannas to tropical rainforests. with over 32 million inhabitants, ghana is the second-most populous country in west africa, after nigeria.[11] the capital and largest city is accra; other major cities are kumasi, tamale, and sekondi-takoradi.\\n\\nthe earliest known kingdoms to emerge in what today is modern ghana were the mole-dagbani states. the bono state existed in the area that is modern ghana during the 11th century.[12] kingdoms and empires such as kingdom of dagbon in the north[13] and the ashanti empire in the south emerged over the centuries.[14] beginning in the 15th century, the portuguese empire, followed by other european powers, contested the area for trading rights, until the british ultimately established control of the coast by the 19th century. following over a century of colonial resistance, the current borders of the country took shape, encompassing 4 separate british colonial territories: gold coast, ashanti, the northern territories, and british togoland. these were unified as an independent dominion within the commonwealth of nations. on 6 march 1957, ghana became the first country in sub-saharan africa to achieve sovereignty.[15][16][17] ghana subsequently became influential in decolonisation efforts and the pan-african movement.[18]\\n\\nghana is a multi-ethnic country with linguistic and religious groups;[19] while the akan are the largest ethnic group, they constitute a plurality. most ghanaians are christians (71.3%); almost a fifth are muslims; a tenth practise traditional faiths or report no religion.[3] ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who is head of state and head of government.[20] for political stability in africa, ghana ranked 7th in the 2012 ibrahim index of african governance and 5th in the 2012 fragile states index. it has maintained since 1993 one of the freest and most stable governments on the continent, and it performs relatively well in healthcare, economic growth, and human development,[18] so that it has a significant influence in west africa and africa as a whole.[21] ghana is highly integrated in international affairs, being a founding member of the non-aligned movement, african union and a member of the economic community of west african states, group of 24 and commonwealth of nations.[22]\\n\\netymology\\nghana means \"king\"[23] and was the title accorded to the kings of the medieval ghana empire in west africaâ€”not to be confused with today\\'s ghana, for the empire was further north, in modern-day mali, senegal and southern mauritania, as well as in the region of guinea.[citation needed]\\n\\nthe republic of ghana used the word in its name because of \"indications that present-day [akan] inhabitants descended from migrants who moved south from the ancient kingdom of ghana.\"[24]\\n\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of ghana\\nmedieval kingdoms\\nmain articles: ashanti empire and kingdom of dagbon\\n\\nan 1850 map showing the akan kingdom of ashanti within the guinea region and surrounding regions in west africa\\n\\n18th-century ashanti brass kuduo. gold dust and nuggets were kept in kuduo, as were other items of personal value and significance. as receptacles for their owners\\' kra, or life force, kuduo were prominent features of ceremonies designed to honour and protect that individual.\\nthe earliest known kingdoms to emerge in modern ghana were the mole-dagbani states.[25] the mole-dagomba came on horseback from what later became burkina faso under a single leader, naa gbewaa.[26] they invaded and occupied the lands of the local people ruled by the tendamba (land god priests), established themselves as the rulers over the locals, and made gambaga their capital.[27] the death of naa gbewaa caused secession among their children, some of whom broke off and founded separate states including mamprugu and nanung.[28][29]\\n\\nthe akan-speaking peoples began to move into what later became ghana toward the 15th century.[25][30] by the 16th century, the akans were established in the akan state called bonoman, for which the brong-ahafo region was named.[25][31] from the 17th century, akans emerged from what is believed to have been the bonoman area, to create akan states, mainly based on gold trading.[32] these states included bonoman (brong-ahafo region), ashanti (ashanti region), denkyira (western north region), mankessim kingdom (central region), and akwamu (eastern region).[25] by the 19th century, the territory of the southern part of ghana was included in the kingdom of ashanti.[25] the government of the ashanti empire operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralised kingdom with a specialised bureaucracy centred in the capital city of kumasi.[25] prior to akan contact with europeans, the akan people created an economy based on principally gold and gold bar commodities, which were traded with other states in africa.[25][33] the ga-dangme and ewe migrated westward from south-western nigeria. the ewe migrated from oyo area with their gbe-speaking kinsmen (adja, fon, phera gun)and in transition, settled in ketou in benin republic, tado in togo and with nortsie ( a walled town on present-day togo)as their final dispersal point. their dispersal from nortsie was necessitated by the high-handed rule of king agorkorli (agor akorlie). the ga- dangme occupy the greater accra region and parts of the eastern region, while the ewe are found in the volta region as well as the neighbouring togo, benin republic and nigeria ( around badagry area).\\n\\neuropean contact and colonialism\\nsee also: slave coast of west africa and dutch slave coast\\n\\nthe portuguese established the portuguese gold coast with the construction of elmina castle (castelo da mina) by diogo de azambuja in 1482, making it the oldest european building in sub-saharan africa.\\nakan trade with european states began after contact with the portuguese in the 15th century.[34] european contact was by the portuguese people, who came to the gold coast region in the 15th century to trade. the portuguese then established the portuguese gold coast (costa do ouro), focused on the availability of gold.[35] the portuguese built a trading lodge at a coastal settlement called anomansah (the perpetual drink) which they renamed sã£o jorge da mina.[35] in 1481, king john ii of portugal commissioned diogo de azambuja to build the elmina castle, which was completed in 3 years.[35] by 1598, the dutch had joined the portuguese in the gold trade, establishing the dutch gold coast (nederlandse bezittingen ter kuste van guinea - \\'dutch properties at the guinea coast\\') and building forts at fort komenda and kormantsi.[36] in 1617, the dutch captured the elmina castle from the portuguese and axim in 1642 (fort st anthony).[36]\\n\\neuropean traders had joined in gold trading by the 17th century, including the swedes, establishing the swedish gold coast (svenska guldkusten), and denmarkâ€“norway, establishing the danish gold coast (danske guldkyst or dansk guinea).[37] european traders participated in the atlantic slave trade in this area.[38] more than 30 forts and castles were built by the merchants. the germans established the brandenburger gold coast or groãÿ friedrichsburg).[39] in 1874, great britain established control over some parts of the country, assigning these areas the status of the british gold coast.[40] military engagements occurred between british colonial powers and akan nation-states. the kingdom of ashanti defeated the british some times in the 100-year-long anglo-ashanti wars and eventually lost with the war of the golden stool in 1900.[41][42][43]\\n\\ntransition to independence\\nsee also: dominion

1947, the newly formed united gold coast convention led by \"the big six\" called for \"self-government within the shortest possible time\" following the 1946 gold coast legislative election.[37][44] kwame nkrumah, a ghanaian nationalist who led ghana from 1957 to 1966 as the country\\'s first prime minister and president, formed the convention people\\'s party in 1949 with the motto \"self-government now\".[37] the party initiated a \"positive action\" campaign involving non-violent protests, strikes and non-cooperation with the british authorities. nkrumah was arrested and sentenced to one year imprisonment during this time. in the gold coast\\'s 1951 general election, he was elected to parliament and was released from prison.[37] he became prime minister in 1952 and began a policy of africanization.[citation needed]\\n\\non 6 march 1957 at midnight, the gold coast, ashanti, the northern territories, and british togoland were unified as one single independent dominion within the british commonwealth under the name ghana. this was done under the ghana independence act 1957. the current flag of ghana, consisting of the colours red, gold, green, and a black star, dates back to this unification.[45] on 1 july 1960, following the ghanaian constitutional referendum and ghanaian presidential election, nkrumah declared ghana a republic and assumed the presidency.[15][16][17][37] 6 march is the nation\\'s independence day, and 1 july is celebrated as republic day.[46][47]\\n\\nnkrumah led an authoritarian regime in ghana, as he repressed political opposition and conducted elections that were not free and fair.[48][49][50][51][52] in 1964, a constitutional amendment made ghana a one-party state, with nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party.[53] nkrumah was the first african head of state to promote the concept of pan-africanism, which he had been introduced to during his studies at lincoln university, pennsylvania in the united states, at the time when marcus garvey was known for his \"back to africa movement\".[37] he merged the teachings of garvey, martin luther king jr. and the naturalised ghanaian scholar w. e. b. du bois into the formation of 1960s ghana.[37] osagyefo dr. kwame nkrumah, as he became known, played an instrumental part in the founding of the non-aligned movement, and in establishing the kwame nkrumah ideological institute to teach his ideologies of communism and socialism.[54] his life achievements were recognised by ghanaians during his centenary birthday celebration, and the day was instituted as a public holiday in ghana (founders\\' day).[55]\\n\\noperation cold chop and aftermath\\nmain article: history of ghana (1966â€“1979)\\nthe government of nkrumah was subsequently overthrown in a coup by the ghana armed forces, codenamed \"operation cold chop\". this occurred while nkrumah was abroad with zhou enlai in the people\\'s republic of china, on a fruitless mission to hanoi, vietnam, to help end the vietnam war. the coup took place on 24 february 1966, led by colonel emmanuel kwasi kotoka and brigadier akwasi afrifa. the national liberation council was formed, chaired by lieutenant general joseph a. ankrah.[56]\\n\\na series of alternating military and civilian governments, often affected by economic instabilities,[57] ruled ghana from 1966, ending with the ascent to power of flight lieutenant jerry john rawlings of the provisional national defence council in 1981.[58] these changes resulted in the suspension of the constitution in 1981 and the banning of political parties.[59] the economy soon declined, so rawlings negotiated a structural adjustment plan, changing many old economic policies, and growth recovered during the mid-1980s.[59] a new constitution restoring multi-party system politics was promulgated in the presidential election of 1992, in which rawlings was elected, and again in the general election of 1996.[60]\\n\\nin a tribal war in northern ghana in 1994, between the konkomba and other ethnic groups, including the nanumba, dagomba and gonja, between 1,000 and 2,000 people were killed and 150,000 people were displaced.[61]\\n\\n\\ntraditional chiefs in 2015\\nafter the 2000 general election, john kufuor of the new patriotic party became president of ghana on 7 january 2001 and was re-elected in 2004, thus also serving two terms (the term limit) as president of ghana and marking the first time under the fourth republic that power was transferred from one legitimately elected head of state and head of government to another.[60]\\n\\nnana akufo-addo, the ruling party candidate, was defeated in a very close 2008 general election by john atta mills of the national democratic congress.[62][63] mills died of natural causes and was succeeded by vice president john mahama on 24 july 2012.[64] following the 2012 general election, mahama became president in his own right,[65] and ghana was described as a \"stable democracy\".[66][67] as a result of the 2016 general election,[68] nana akufo-addo became president on 7 january 2017.[69] he was re-elected after a tightly contested election in 2020.[70]\\n\\nto combat deforestation, on 11 june 2021 ghana inaugurated green ghana day, with the aim of planting 5 million trees in a concentrated effort to preserve the country\\'s rainforest

alternated between civilian and military governments until january 1993, when the military government gave way to the fourth republic of ghana after presidential and parliamentary elections in late 1992. the 1992 constitution of ghana divides powers among a commander-in-chief of the ghana armed forces (president of ghana), parliament (parliament of ghana), cabinet (cabinet of ghana), council of state (ghanaian council of state), and an independent judiciary (judiciary of ghana). the government is elected by universal suffrage after every four years.[83] nana akufo-addo won the presidency in the general election in 2016, defeating incumbent john mahama. he also won the 2020 election after the presidential election results were challenged at the supreme court by flagbearer of the ndc, john mahama. presidents are limited to two four-year terms in office. the president can serve a second term only upon re-election. the 2012 fragile states index indicated that ghana is ranked the 67th-least fragile state in the world and the fifth-least fragile state in africa. ghana ranked 112th out of 177 countries on the index.[84] ghana ranked as the 64th-least corrupt and politically corrupt country in the world out of all 174 countries ranked and ranked as the fifth-least corrupt and politically corrupt country in africa out of 53 countries in the 2012 transparency international

life-form, or shapes of inanimate and man-made objects. the meanings of the motifs may be categorised into aesthetics, ethics, human relations, and concepts.[231] the adinkra symbols have a decorative function as tattoos but also represent objects that encapsulate evocative messages that convey traditional wisdom, aspects of life, or the environment. there are many symbols with distinct meanings,

weavers used raffia fibres to weave cloths that looked like kenten (a basket); and thus were referred to as kenten ntoma; meaning basket cloth.[233] the original akan name of the cloth was nsaduaso or

federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine minor outlying islands,[i] and 326 indian reservations. it is the world\\'s third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] it shares land borders with canada to its north and with mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the bahamas, cuba, russia, and other nations.[j] with a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the americas and the third-most populous in the world. the national capital of the united states is washington, d.c., and its most populous city and principal financial center is new york city.\\n\\nindigenous peoples have inhabited the americas for thousands of years. beginning in 1607, british colonization led to the establishment of the thirteen colonies in what is now the eastern united states. they clashed with the british crown over taxation and political representation which led to the american revolution and the ensuing revolutionary war. the united states declared independence on july 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. the country began expanding across north america, spanning the continent by 1848. sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the confederate states of america, which fought the remaining states of the union during the american civil war (1861â€“1865). with the union\\'s victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. by 1890, the united states had established itself as a great power, becoming the world\\'s largest economy. after japan\\'s attack on pearl harbor in 1941, the u.s. entered world war ii on the side of the allies. the aftermath of the war left the united states and the soviet union as the world\\'s two superpowers and led to the cold war. during the cold war, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. they also competed in the space race, which culminated in the 1969 landing of apollo 11, making the u.s. the only nation to land humans on the moon. with the soviet union\\'s collapse and the subsequent end of the cold war in 1991, the united states emerged as the world\\'s sole superpower.\\n\\nthe united states government is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. it has a bicameral national legislature composed of the house of representatives, a lower house based on population; and the senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction. the u.s. ranks highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. it has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies, and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. as a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the u.s. has been drastically shaped by the world\\'s largest immigrant population.\\n\\nthe united states is a developed country that has the highest disposable income per capita in the world. its economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global gdp and is the world\\'s largest by gdp at market exchange rates. it is the world\\'s largest importer and second-largest exporter, and possesses the largest amount of wealth of any country. the united states is a founding member of the united nations, world bank, international monetary fund, organization of american states, nato, world health organization, and is a permanent member of the united nations security council. it wields considerable global influence as one of the world\\'s foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and

back to a letter from january 2, 1776, written by stephen moylan, a continental army aide to general george washington, to joseph reed, washington\\'s aide-de-camp. moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the united states of america to spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.[26][27][28] the first known publication of the phrase \"united states of america\" was in an anonymous essay in the virginia gazette newspaper in williamsburg, on april 6, 1776.[29]\\n\\nby june 1776, the name \"united states of america\" appeared in drafts of the articles of confederation and perpetual union, authored by john dickinson, a founding father from the province of pennsylvania,[30][31] and in the declaration of independence, written primarily by thomas jefferson and adopted by the second continental congress in philadelphia, on july 4, 1776.[30]\\n\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of the united states\\nfor a topical guide, see outline of united

suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[32][33][34] the clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000bc, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement in the americas.[35][36] this was likely the first of three major waves of migration into north america; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day athabaskans, aleuts, and eskimos.[37]\\n\\nover time, indigenous cultures in north america grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-columbian mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[38] the city-state of cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-columbian archaeological site in present-day united states.[39] in the four corners region in present-day southwestern united states, the culture of ancestral puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[40] the algonquian, consisting of peoples who speak algonquian languages, were one of the most populous and widespread north american indigenous peoples.[41] these people were historically prominent along the atlantic coast and in the saint lawrence river and great lakes regions. before european immigrants made contact, most of the algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"three sisters\". by european contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands\\' productivity and manage land.[42][43][44][45][46][47] the ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[48] the iroquois confederation haudenosaunee, located in the southern great lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[49]\\n\\nestimating the native population of north america following the arrival of european immigrants is difficult.[50][51] douglas h. ubelaker of the smithsonian institution estimated a population of 93,000 in the south atlantic states and a population of 473,000 in the gulf states,[52] but most academics regard this figure as too low.[50] anthropologist henry f. dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting that approximately 1.1 million resided on the shores of the gulf of mexico, 2.2 million people living between florida and massachusetts, 5.2 million in the mississippi valley and tributaries, and around 700,000 in the florida peninsula.[50][51]\\n\\nthe italian explorer giovanni da verrazzano, sent by france to the new world in 1525, encountered native american inhabitants in the present-day new york bay region.[53] the spanish empire set up their first settlements in florida and new mexico, including in saint augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation\\'s oldest city,[54] and santa fe (1598). the french established their own settlements along the mississippi river and gulf of mexico, including in new orleans (1718) and mobile (1702).[55]\\n\\ncolonization, settlement, and

plymouth colony in 1620.[56][57] many english settlers were dissenting christians who fled england seeking religious freedom.\\n\\nthe continent\\'s first elected legislative assembly, the house of burgesses in virginia, was founded in 1619. in 1636, harvard college in cambridge, massachusetts bay colony was founded as the first institution of higher education. the mayflower compact and the fundamental orders of connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies.[58][59] the native population of america declined after european arrival,[60][61][62] primarily as a result of infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles.[63][64] by the mid-1670s, the british defeated and seized the territory of dutch settlers in new netherland, in the mid-atlantic region.[citation needed]\\n\\nduring the 17th century european colonization many european settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with native americans, particularly in king philip\\'s war. in addition to fighting european settlers, native americans also often fought neighboring tribes. but in many cases, the natives and settlers came to develop a mutual dependency. settlers traded for food and animal pelts, and native americans traded for guns, tools, and other european goods.[65] native americans taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. european missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the native americans and urged them to adopt european agricultural practices and lifestyles.[66][67] with the increased european colonization of north america, however, native americans were often displaced or killed during conflicts.[68]\\n\\neuropean settlers also began trafficking african slaves into the colonial united states via the transatlantic slave trade.[69] by the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the southern colonies.[70] colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts for or against it as well as laws designed to keep blacks subservient.[71][72]\\n\\nin what was then considered british america, the thirteen colonies[l] were administered as overseas dependencies by the british.[73] all colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except jews and, in some areas, catholics.[74][75] with very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing native american populations.[76] the christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s, known as the great awakening, fueled colonial interest in both religion and religious liberty.[77] excluding the native american population, the thirteen colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, representing a population that was then roughly a third the size of great britain. by the 1770s, despite continuing new immigrant arrivals from britain and other european regions, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of americans had been born overseas.[78] the colonies\\' distance from britain had allowed for the development of self-governance in the colonies, but it encountered periodic efforts by british monarchs to reassert royal authority.[79]\\n\\nrevolution and the new nation (1763â€“1789)\\nmain article: history of the united states

materiel from the colonies, the british began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. in 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the british government that extracted taxes from them, the first continental congress met in philadelphia and passed the continental association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of british goods. the british attempted to disarm the americans, resulting in the battles of lexington and concord on april 19, 1775, igniting the american revolutionary war. the then united colonies responded by again convening in philadelphia as the second continental congress where, in june 1775, they appointed george washington as commander-in-chief of the continental army, which was initially comprised of various american patriot militias resisting the british army. in june 1776, the second continental congress charged acommittee with writing a declaration of independence, largely drafted by thomas jefferson.[citation needed]\\n\\non july 4, 1776, the second continental congress with alterations unanimously adopted and issued the declaration of independence, which famously stated: \"we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" the adoption of the declaration of independence is celebrated annually on july 4 in the united states as independence day.[80] in 1777, the american victory at the battle of saratoga resulted in the capture of a british army, and led to france and their ally spain joining in the war against them. after the surrender of a second british army at the siege of yorktown in 1781, britain signed a peace treaty. american sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the mississippi river, from what is present-day canada in the north and florida in the south.[81] tensions with britain remained, leading to the war of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[82]\\n\\nin 1781, the articles of confederation and perpetual union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[80] considered one of the most important legislative acts of the confederation congress,[83] northwest ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the articles. the prohibition of slavery in the territory had the practical effect of establishing the ohio river as the geographic divide between slave states and free states from the appalachian mountains to the mississippi river, an extension of the masonâ€“dixon line. it also helped set the stage for later federal political conflicts over slavery during the 19th century until the american civil war.[citation needed]\\n\\nas it became increasingly apparent that the confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the philadelphia convention of 1787, where the united states constitution was authored and then ratified in state conventions in 1788. the u.s. constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[84] going into effect in 1789, it reorganized the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. george washington, who led the continental army to victory in the revolutionary war and then willingly relinquished power, was elected the new nation\\'s first president under the new constitution. the bill of rights was adopted in 1791, originally forbidding only federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections,[85] portions of the bill of rights are now applied to state and local governments by virtue of both state and federal court decisions.[86]\\n\\nexpansion (1789â€“1860)\\nmain article: history of the united states (1789â€“1849)\\n\\nthe old plantation, a c.â€‰1790 painting of a plantation by a south carolina

during the revolution many in the new nation began to question the practice.[87] regional divisions over slavery grew in the ensuing decades. in the north, several prominent founding fathers such as john adams, roger sherman, alexander hamilton, john jay, and benjamin franklin advocated for the abolition of slavery, and by the 1810s every state in the region had, those emancipations being the first in the atlantic world.[88]\\n\\n\\nanimated map of the territorial evolution of the united states (click to view full size image)\\nin the late 18th century, american settlers began to expand further westward, some of them with a sense of manifest destiny.[89][90] the louisiana purchase (1803) nearly doubled the acreage of the united states, effectively ending french colonial interest in north america and their opposition to american westward expansion. [91] spain ceded florida and other gulf coast territory in 1819,[92] the missouri compromise (1820) admitted missouri as a slave state and maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining louisiana purchase lands north of the 36â°30â€² parallel. the outcome de facto sectionalized the country into two factions: free states, which forbade slavery; and slave states, which protected the institution; it was controversial, widely seen as dividing the country along sectarian lines.[93] although the national government outlawed american participation in the atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the deep south, and along with it the use of slave labor.[94][95][96] the invention of the cotton gin lowering the cost of cotton production and exponentially increasing profits spurred the entrenchment of slavery on sourhtern agricultural plantations, with regional elites and intellectuals increasingly viewing the institution as a positive good instead of a necessary evil.[97] the second great awakening, especially in the period 1800â€“1840, converted millions to evangelical protestantism. in the north, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[98] in the south, methodists and baptists proselytized among slave populations.[99]\\n\\nas americans expanded further into land inhabited by native americans, the federal government often applied policies of indian removal or assimilation.[100][101] the trail of tears in the 1830s exemplified the indian removal policy that forcibly resettled indians. the displacement prompted a long series of american indian wars west of the mississippi river[102] and eventually conflict with mexico.[103] most of these conflicts ended with the cession of native american territory and their confinement to indian reservations.\\n\\nthe republic of texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism,[90] and the 1846 oregon treaty with britain led to u.s. control of the present-day american northwest.[104] victory in the mexicanâ€“american war resulted in the 1848 mexican cession of california and much of the present-day american southwest, with the u.s. now spanning the continent.[89][105] the california gold rush of 1848â€“1849 spurred migration to the pacific coast, which led to the california genocide[106] and the creation of additional western states.[107]\\n\\ncivil war and reconstruction (1860â€“1876)\\nmain articles: history of the united states (1849â€“1865) and

secession and formed the confederate states of america, while the remaining states, known as the union, maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[110] on april 12, 1861, the confederacy initiated military conflict by bombarding fort sumter, a federal garrison in charleston harbor in south carolina. the american civil war, the deadliest military conflict in american history, ensued and was fought between 1861 and 1865. the war resulted in the deaths of approximately 620000 soldiers from both sides and upwards of 50000 civilians, most of them in the south.[111] in early july 1863, the civil war began to turn in the union\\'s favor following the union army under general ulysses s. grant successfully splitting the confederacy in two by capturing vicksburg in the west, denying it any further movement along or across the mississippi river and preventing supplies from texas and arkansas that might sustain the war effort from passing east, almost simultaneous with victory in the battle of gettysburg, where union army general george meade halted confederate army general robert e. lee\\'s invasion of the north. in april 1865, following the union army\\'s

rebuilding of the south and to ensure the rights of african americans, and the so-called reconstruction amendments to the constitution guaranteed the abolishment of slavery, full citizenship to americans of african descent, and suffrage for adult black men. they persisted until the compromise of 1877.[113]\\n\\nto encourage additional westward settlement the homestead acts were several laws in the united states by which an applicant could acquire ownership of government land or the public domain, typically called a \"homestead\". in all, more than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi) of public land, or nearly 10 percent of the total area of the united states, was given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the mississippi river. the southern homestead act of 1866 was enacted specifically to break a cycle of debt during reconstruction. prior to this act, blacks and impoverished whites alike were having trouble buying land or did not have the means to travel west. sharecropping and tenant farming had become ways of life. this act attempted to solve this by selling land at low prices so marginalized southerners could buy it. many, however, could still not participate because the low prices were still out of reach.[114]\\n\\ndevelopment of the modern united states (1876â€“1914)\\nmain article: history of the united

york city, and from 1892, through the immigration station on ellis island, but various ethnic groups settled in different locations. new york and other large cities of the east coast became home to large jewish, irish, and italian populations, while many germans and central europeans moved to the midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining. at the same time, about one million french canadians migrated from quebec to new england.[129] the great migration, which began around 1910, resulted in millions of african americans leaving the rural south for urban areas in the north.[130]\\n\\nrapid

of the economy, with j. p. morgan playing a notable role. the united states also emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry in the early 20th century.[132] these changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, immigration, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[133][134][135] this period eventually ended with

roth. this would become the united states\\' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented american chefs would study prior to successful careers.[565][566] the united states is

       " 'politics (from ancient greek ï€î¿î»î¹ï„î¹îºî¬ (politikã¡) \\'affairs of the cities\\') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. the branch of social science that studies politics and government is referred to as political science.\\n\\nit may be used positively in the context of a \"political solution\" which is compromising and nonviolent,[1] or descriptively as \"the art or science of government\", but also often carries a negative connotation.[2] the concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or limitedly, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it.\\n\\na variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one\\'s own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising internal and external force, including warfare against adversaries.[3][4][5][6][7] politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.\\n\\nin modern nation states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas. members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders. an election is usually a competition between different parties.\\n\\na political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a society. the history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as plato\\'s republic, aristotle\\'s politics, confucius\\'s political manuscripts and chanakya\\'s arthashastra.[8]\\n\\netymology\\nthe english politics has its roots in the name of aristotle\\'s classic work, politikã¡, which introduced the greek term politikã¡ (î\\xa0î¿î»î¹ï„î¹îºî¬, \\'affairs of the cities\\'). in the mid-15th century, aristotle\\'s composition would be rendered in early modern english as polettiques [sic],[a][9] which would become politics in modern english.\\n\\nthe singular politic first attested in english in 1430, coming from middle french politiqueâ€”itself taking from politicus,[10] a latinization of the greek ï€î¿î»î¹ï„î¹îºïœï‚ (politikos) from ï€î¿î»î¯ï„î·ï‚ (polites, \\'citizen\\') and ï€ïœî»î¹ï‚ (polis, \\'city\\').[11]\\n\\ndefinitions\\nharold lasswell: \"who gets what, when, how\"[12]\\ndavid easton: \"the authoritative allocation of values for a society\"[13]\\nvladimir lenin: \"the most concentrated expression of economics\"[14]\\notto von bismarck: \"the capacity of always choosing at each instant, in constantly changing situations, the least harmful, the most useful\"[15]\\nbernard crick: \"a distinctive form of rule whereby people act together through institutionalized procedures to resolve differences\"[16]\\nadrian leftwich: \"comprises all the activities of co-operation, negotiation and conflict within and between societies\"[17]\\napproaches\\nthere are several ways in which approaching politics has been conceptualized.\\n\\nextensive and limited\\nadrian leftwich has differentiated views of politics based on how extensive or limited their perception of what accounts as \\'political\\' is.[18] the extensive view sees politics as present across the sphere of human social relations, while the limited view restricts it to certain contexts. for example, in a more restrictive way, politics may be viewed as primarily about governance,[19] while a feminist perspective could argue that sites which have been viewed traditionally as non-political, should indeed be viewed as political as well.[20] this latter position is encapsulated in the slogan \"the personal is political\", which disputes the distinction between private and public issues. politics may also be defined by the use of power, as has been argued by robert a. dahl.[21]\\n\\nmoralism and realism\\nsome perspectives on politics view it empirically as an exercise of power, while others see it as a social function with a normative basis.[22] this distinction has been called the difference between political moralism and political realism.[23] for moralists, politics is closely linked to ethics, and is at its extreme in utopian thinking.[23] for example, according to hannah arendt, the view of aristotle was that \"to be politicalâ€¦meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through violence;\"[24] while according to bernard crick \"politics is the way in which free societies are governed. politics is politics and other forms of rule are something else.\"[25] in contrast, for realists, represented by those such as niccolã² machiavelli, thomas hobbes, and harold lasswell, politics is based on the use of power, irrespective of the ends being pursued.[26][23]\\n\\nconflict and co-operation\\nagonism argues that politics essentially comes down to conflict between conflicting interests. political scientist elmer schattschneider argued that \"at the root of all politics is the universal language of conflict,\"[27] while for carl schmitt the essence of politics is the distinction of \\'friend\\' from foe\\'.[28] this is in direct contrast to the more co-operative views of politics by aristotle and crick. however, a more mixed view between these extremes is provided by irish political scientist michael laver, who noted that:\\n\\npolitics is about the characteristic blend of conflict and co-operation that can be found so often in human interactions. pure conflict is war. pure co-operation is true love. politics is a mixture of both.[29]\\n\\nhistory\\n\\nthe greek philosopher aristotle criticized many of plato\\'s ideas as impracticable, but, like plato, he admires balance and moderation and aims at a harmonious city under the rule of law.[30]\\nmain article: political history of the world\\nsee also: history of political thought\\nthe history of politics spans human history and is not limited to modern institutions of government.\\n\\nprehistoric\\nfrans de waal argued that chimpanzees engage in politics through \"social manipulation to secure and maintain influential positions.\"[31] early human forms of social organizationâ€”bands and tribesâ€”lacked centralized political structures.[32] these are sometimes referred to as stateless societies.\\n\\nearly states\\nin ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers. early dynastic sumer, and early dynastic egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders. moreover, up to the 12th century, many people lived in non-state societies. these range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.\\n\\nstate formation\\nmain article: state formation\\nthere are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.[33]\\n\\nvoluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.[34] the theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation. one of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the hydraulic hypothesis, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.[35]\\n\\nconflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.[34] in contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. some theories in turn argue that warfare was critical for state formation.[34]\\n\\nancient history\\nthe first states of sorts were those of early dynastic sumer and early dynastic egypt, which arose from the uruk period and predynastic egypt respectively around approximately 3000 bc.[36] early dynastic egypt was based around the nile river in the north-east of africa, the kingdom\\'s boundaries being based around the nile and stretching to areas where oases existed.[37] early dynastic sumer was located in southern mesopotamia with its borders extending from the persian gulf to parts of the euphrates and tigris rivers.[36]\\n\\negyptians, romans, and the greeks were the first people known to have explicitly formulated a political philosophy of the state, and to have rationally analyzed political institutions. prior to this, states were described and justified in terms of religious myths.[38]\\n\\nseveral important political innovations of classical antiquity came from the greek city-states (polis) and the roman republic. the greek city-states before the 4th century granted citizenship rights to their free population; in athens these rights were combined with a directly democratic form of government that was to have a long afterlife in political thought and history.[39]\\n\\nmodern states\\n\\nwomen voter outreach (1935)\\nthe peace of westphalia (1648) is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system,[40][41][42] in which external powers should avoid interfering in another country\\'s domestic affairs.[43] the principle of non-interference in other countries\\' domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by swiss jurist emer de vattel.[44] states became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relations. the peace of westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on european states. the \"westphalian\" doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nationsâ€”groups of people united by language and culture.[45]\\n\\nin europe, during the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the multinational empires: the austrian empire, kingdom of france, kingdom of hungary,[46] the russian empire, the spanish empire, the ottoman empire, and the british empire. such empires also existed in asia, africa, and the americas; in the muslim world, immediately after the death of muhammad in 632, caliphates were established, which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires.[47] the multinational empire was an absolute monarchy ruled by a king, emperor or sultan. the population belonged to many ethnic groups, and they spoke many languages. the empire was dominated by one ethnic group, and their language was usually the language of public administration. the ruling dynasty was usually, but not always, from that group. some of the smaller european states were not so ethnically diverse, but were also dynastic states, ruled by a royal house. a few of the smaller states survived, such as the independent principalities of liechtenstein, andorra, monaco, and the republic of san marino.\\n\\nmost theories see the nation state as a 19th-century european phenomenon, facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy, and mass media. however, historians[who?] also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in portugal and the dutch republic.[48] scholars such as steven weber, david woodward, michel foucault, and jeremy black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did not arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source, nor was it an accident of history or political invention.[49][34][50] rather, the nation state is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political geography, and geography[51][52] combined with cartography[53][54] and advances in map-making technologies.[55]\\n\\nsome nation states, such as germany and italy, came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists, during the 19th century. in both cases, the territory was previously divided among other states, some of them very small. liberal ideas of free trade played a role in german unification, which was preceded by a customs union, the zollverein. national self-determination was a key aspect of united states president woodrow wilson\\'s fourteen points, leading to the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire and the ottoman empire after the first world war, while the russian empire became the soviet union after the russian civil war. decolonization lead to the creation of new nation states in place of multinational empires in the third world.\\n\\nglobalization\\nmain article: political globalization\\npolitical globalization began in the 20th century through intergovernmental organizations and supranational unions. the league of nations was founded after world war i, and after world war ii it was replaced by the united nations. various international treaties have been signed through it. regional integration has been pursued by the african union, asean, the european union, and mercosur. international political institutions on the international level include the international criminal court, the international monetary fund, and the world trade organization.\\n\\npolitical science\\n\\nthis section does not cite any sources.

politology. it comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political philosophy, public administration, public policy, gender and politics, and political methodology. furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology/psychiatry,

neuroscience. approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behavioralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism. political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building.\\n\\npolitical system\\nmain article: political system\\nsee also: systems theory in political science\\n\\nmap of european nations coloured by percentage of vote governing party got in last election as of 2022\\n\\nsystems view of politics\\nthe political system defines the process for making official government decisions. it is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systems. according to david easton, \"a political system can be designated as the interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for a society.\"[13] each political system is embedded in a society with its own political culture, and they in turn shape their societies through public policy. the interactions between different political systems are the basis for global politics.\\n\\nforms of government\\n\\nlegislatures are an important political institution. pictured is the parliament of finland.\\nforms of government can be classified by several ways. in terms of the structure of power, there are monarchies (including constitutional monarchies) and republics (usually presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary).\\n\\nthe separation of powers describes the degree of horizontal integration between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and other independent institutions.\\n\\nsource of power\\nthe source of power determines the difference between democracies, oligarchies, and autocracies.\\n\\nin a democracy, political legitimacy is based on popular sovereignty. forms of democracy include representative democracy, direct democracy, and demarchy. these are separated by the way decisions are made, whether by elected representatives, referendums, or by citizen juries. democracies can be either republics or constitutional monarchies.\\n\\noligarchy is a power structure where a minority rules. these may be in the form of anocracy, aristocracy, ergatocracy, geniocracy, gerontocracy, kakistocracy, kleptocracy, meritocracy, noocracy, particracy, plutocracy, stratocracy, technocracy, theocracy, or timocracy.\\n\\nautocracies are either dictatorships (including military dictatorships) or absolute monarchies.\\n\\n\\nthe pathway of regional integration or separation\\nvertical integration\\nin terms of level of vertical integration, political systems can be divided into (from least to most integrated) confederations, federations, and unitary states.\\n\\na federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). in a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. federations were formed first in switzerland, then in the united states in 1776, in canada in 1867 and in germany in 1871 and in 1901, australia. compared to a federation, a confederation has less centralized power.\\n\\nstate\\n\\n  federal states\\n  unitary states\\n  no government\\nall the above forms of government are variations of the same basic polity, the sovereign state. the state has been defined by max weber as a political entity that has monopoly on violence within its territory, while the montevideo convention holds that states need to have a defined territory; a permanent population; a government; and a capacity to enter into international relations.\\n\\na stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state.[56] in stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.[57] stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.[58]\\n\\nwhile stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state. in some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power. over the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.[59]\\n\\nsome political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved. a central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without states.[56][60] the type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.[61] in marxism, marx\\'s theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither away.[62] a related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe marx\\'s anticipated post-capitalist society.\\n\\nconstitutions\\nconstitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. the unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.[63] england did set the fashion of written constitutions during the civil war but after the restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the american colonies after their emancipation and then france after the revolution and the rest of europe including the european colonies.\\n\\nconstitutions often set out separation of powers, dividing the government into the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary (together referred to as the trias politica), in order to achieve checks and balances within the state. additional independent branches may also be created, including civil service commissions, election commissions, and supreme audit institutions.\\n\\npolitical culture\\n\\ninglehart-weltzel cultural map of countries\\npolitical culture describes how culture impacts politics. every political system is embedded in a particular political culture.[64] lucian pye\\'s definition is that \"political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system\".[64]\\n\\ntrust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function.[65] postmaterialism is the degree to which a political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalism.[64] religion has also an impact on political culture.[65]\\n\\npolitical dysfunction\\npolitical corruption\\nmain article: political corruption\\npolitical corruption is the use of powers for illegitimate private gain, conducted by government officials or their network contacts. forms of political corruption include bribery, cronyism, nepotism, and political patronage. forms of political patronage, in turn, includes clientelism, earmarking, pork barreling, slush funds, and spoils systems; as well as political machines, which is a political system that operates for corrupt ends.\\n\\nwhen corruption is embedded in political culture, this may be referred to as patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism. a form of government that is built on corruption is called a kleptocracy (\\'rule of thieves\\').\\n\\ninsincere politics\\nmain article: woke\\nmuch as the word \"woke\" is sometimes used, the words \"politics\" and \"political\" are sometimes used as pejoratives to mean political action that is deemed to be overzealous, performative, or insincere.\\n\\nlevels of politics\\nmacropolitics\\nmain article: global politics\\nmacropolitics can either describe political issues that affect an entire political system (e.g. the nation state), or refer to interactions between political systems (e.g. international relations).[66]\\n\\nglobal politics (or world politics) covers all aspects of politics that affect multiple political systems, in practice meaning any political phenomenon crossing national borders. this can include cities, nation-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and/or international organizations. an important element is international relations: the relations between nation-states may be peaceful when they are conducted through diplomacy, or they may be violent, which is described as war. states that are able to exert strong international influence are referred to as superpowers, whereas less-powerful ones may be called regional or middle powers. the international system of power is called the world order, which is affected by the balance of power that defines the degree of polarity in the system. emerging powers are potentially destabilizing to it, especially if they display revanchism or irredentism.\\n\\npolitics inside the limits of political systems, which in contemporary context correspond to national borders, are referred to as domestic politics. this includes most forms of public policy, such as social policy, economic policy, or law enforcement, which are executed by the state bureaucracy.\\n\\nmesopolitics\\nmesopolitics describes the politics of intermediary structures within a political system, such as national political parties or movements.[66]\\n\\na political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in political campaigns, educational outreach, or protest actions. parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision, bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.[67]\\n\\npolitical parties within a particular political system together form the party system, which can be either multiparty, two-party, dominant-party, or one-party, depending on the level of pluralism. this is affected by characteristics of the political system, including its electoral system. according to duverger\\'s law, first-past-the-post systems are likely to lead to two-party systems, while proportional representation systems are more likely to create a multiparty system.\\n\\nmicropolitics\\nmicropolitics describes the actions of individual actors within the political system.[66] this is often described as political participation.[68] political participation may take many forms, including:\\n\\nactivism\\nboycott\\ncivil disobedience\\ndemonstration\\npetition\\npicketing\\nstrike action\\ntax resistance\\nvoting (or its opposite, abstentionism)\\npolitical values\\nmain article: political philosophy\\ndemocracy\\npart of the politics series\\ndemocracy\\nhistorytheorycriticism\\ntypes\\nrelated topics\\nicon politics portal\\nvte\\nmain article: democracy\\ndemocracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. the uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy. democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.[69]\\n\\namong modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of democracy: aggregative, deliberative, and radical.[70]\\n\\naggregative\\nthe theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit the preferences of citizens, and aggregate them together to determine what social policies the society should adopt. therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.\\n\\ndifferent variants of aggregative democracy exist. under minimalism, democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. according to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not \"rule\" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. joseph schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book capitalism, socialism, and democracy.[71] contemporary proponents of minimalism include william h. riker, adam przeworski, richard posner.\\n\\naccording to the theory of direct democracy, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. political activity can be valuable in itself, it socializes and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.\\n\\ngovernments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voterâ€”with half to their left and the other half to their right. this is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. anthony downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. downs laid out this view in his 1957 book an economic theory of democracy.[72]\\n\\nrobert a. dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). he uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. first and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. however, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.[73] similarly, ronald dworkin argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"[74]\\n\\ndeliberative\\nmain article: deliberative democracy\\ndeliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation. unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.[75][76][77] if the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.\\n\\nradical\\nmain article: radical democracy\\nradical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. democracy\\'s role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.\\n\\nequality\\n\\ntwo-axis political

equality\\nequality is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same social status, especially socioeconomic status, including protection of human rights and dignity, and equal access to certain social goods and social services. furthermore, it may also include health equality, economic equality and other social securities. social equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination motivated by an inalienable part of a person\\'s identity. to this end there must be equal justice under law, and equal opportunity regardless of, for example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability.\\n\\nleftâ€“right spectrum\\na common way of understanding politics is through the leftâ€“right political spectrum, which ranges from left-wing politics via centrism to right-wing politics. this classification is comparatively recent and dates from the french revolution, when those members of the national assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the church sat on the right.[86]\\n\\ntoday, the left is generally progressivist, seeking social progress in society. the more extreme elements of the left, named the far-left, tend to support revolutionary means for achieving this. this includes ideologies such as communism and marxism. the center-left, on the other hand, advocate for more reformist approaches, for example that of social democracy.\\n\\nin contrast, the right is generally motivated by conservatism, which seeks to conserve what it sees as the important elements of society such as law and order, limited federal government and preserving individual freedoms. the far-right goes beyond this, and often represents a reactionary turn against progress, seeking to undo it. examples of such ideologies have included fascism and nazism. the center-right may be less clear-cut and more mixed in this regard, with neoconservatives supporting the spread of free markets and capitalism, and one-nation conservatives more open to social welfare programs.\\n\\naccording to norberto bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequalityâ€”believing it to be unethical or unnatural,[87] while the right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.[88] some ideologies, notably christian democracy, claim to combine left and right-wing politics; according to geoffrey k. roberts and patricia hogwood, \"in terms of ideology, christian democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and christian principles.\"[89] movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include fascist terza posizione economic politics in italy and peronism in argentina.[90][91]\\n\\nfreedom\\nmain article: political freedom\\npolitical freedom (also known as political liberty or autonomy) is a central concept in political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies. negative liberty has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion and unreasonable external constraints on action, often enacted through civil and political rights, while positive liberty is the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society. this capability approach to freedom requires economic, social and cultural rights in order to be realized.\\n\\nauthoritarianism and libertarianism\\nauthoritarianism and libertarianism disagree the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state. one author describes authoritarian political systems as those where \"individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities,\"[92] while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereign. in their purest form, libertarians are anarchists,[93] who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities, while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society.[94]\\n\\nfor instance, classical liberalism (also known as laissez-faire liberalism)[95] is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government. this includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of john locke, adam smith, david hume, david ricardo, voltaire, montesquieu and others. according to the libertarian institute for humane studies, \"the libertarian, or \\'classical liberal,\\' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by \\'as much liberty as possible\\' and \\'as little government as necessary.\\'\"[96] for anarchist political philosopher l. susan brown (1993), \"liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism\\'s competitive property relations.\"[97]',\n",

later investigations revealed a y-chromosome in her body cells, and the analysis showed that she was probably a 46,xx/46,xy mosaic female.[3]\\nin 1953, a human chimera was reported in the british medical journal. a woman was found to have blood containing two different blood types. apparently this resulted from her twin brother\\'s cells living in her body.[4] a 1996 study found that such blood group chimerism is not rare.[5]\\nin 2002, lydia fairchild was denied public assistance in washington state when dna evidence appeared to show that she was not the mother of her children. a lawyer for the prosecution heard of a human chimera in new england, karen keegan, and suggested the possibility to the defense, who were able to show that fairchild, too, was a chimera with two sets of dna, and that one of those sets could have been the mother of the children.[6]\\nin 2002, an article in the new england journal of medicine described a woman in whom tetragametic chimerism was unexpectedly identified after she underwent preparations for kidney transplant. those preparations for the transplant required the patient and her immediate family to undergo histocompatibility testing, the result of which had suggested that she was not the biological mother of two of her three children.[7]\\nin 2009, singer taylor muhl discovered that what was always thought to be a large birthmark on her torso was actually caused by chimerism.\\nnon-intentional chimerism related to treatments\\nseveral cases of unusual chimera phenomena have been reported in bone marrow recipients.\\nin 2019, the blood and seminal fluid of a man in reno, nevada (who had undergone a vasectomy), exhibited only the genetic content of his bone marrow donor. swabs from his lips, cheek and tongue showed mixed dna content.[8]\\nthe dna content of semen from an assault case in 2004 matched that of a man who had been in prison at the time of the assault, but who had been a bone marrow donor for his brother, who was later determined to have committed the crime.[8][9][10]\\nin 2008, a man was killed in a traffic accident that occurred in seoul, south korea. in order to identify him, his dna was analyzed. results revealed that the dna of his blood, along with some of his organs, appeared to show that he was female. it was later determined that he had received a bone marrow transplant from his daughter.[8]\\nanother instance of treatment-related human chimerism was published in 1998, where a male human had some partially developed female organs due to chimerism. he had been conceived by in-vitro fertilization.[11]\\nhuman-animal chimeras\\nfurther information: xenotransplantation\\nfor hybrids, see humanâ€“animal hybrid.\\nhuman-animal chimeras include humans having undergone non-human to human xenotransplantation, which is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another.[12][13]\\n\\npatient derived xenografts are created by xenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice, and is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research.[14]\\n\\nthe first stable human-animal chimeras to actually exist were first created by shanghai second medical university scientists in 2003, the result of having fused human cells with rabbit eggs.[13]\\nin 2017, a human-pig chimera was reported to have been created; the chimera was also reported to have 0.001% human cells, with the balance being pig.[15][16][17] the embryo consisted mostly pig cells and some human cells. scientists stated that they hope to use this technology to address the shortage of donor organs.[18][19]\\nin 2021, a human-monkey chimera was created as a joint project between the salk institute in the us and kunming university in china and published in the journal cell.[20] this involved injecting human stem cells into monkey embryos. the embryos were only allowed to grow for a few days, but the study demonstrated that some of these embryos still had human stem cells surviving at the end of the experiments. because humans are more closely related to monkeys than other animals, it means there is more chance of the chimeric embryos surviving for longer periods so that organs can develop. the project has opened up possibilities into organ transplantation as well as ethical concerns particularly concerning human brain development in primates.[21]\\nchimera identification\\nnon-artificial chimerism is so rare that there have only been 100 confirmed cases in humans.[citation needed] however, this may be due to the fact that humans might not be aware that they have this condition to begin with. there are usually no signs or symptoms for chimerism other than a few physical symptoms such as hyper-pigmentation, hypo-pigmentation, or heterochromia iridum (possessing two different colored eyes). however, these signs do not necessarily mean an individual is a chimera and should only be seen as possible symptoms. again, forensic investigation or curiosity over a failed maternity/paternity dna test usually leads to the accidental discovery of this condition. by simply undergoing a dna test, which usually consists of either a swift cheek swab or a blood test, the discovery of the once unknown second genome is made, therefore identifying that individual as a chimera.[22]\\n\\nchimerism and intersex\\nthe concept of a \"human hermaphrodite\" resulting from chimerism is largely a misconception. most intersex individuals are not chimeras,[23][24] and most human chimeras are not observed to have intersex traits.[24] theoretically, if a gynandromorphic human chimera were to have fully functioning male and female gonad tissue, popular speculation suggests such an individual could self-fertilize; this hypothesis is backed by the fact that hermaphroditic animal species commonly reproduce in this way. however, no such case of functional self-fertilization has ever been documented in humans;[25] many biologists have concluded that this form of \"true hermaphroditism\" does not occur in mammals,[26][27][28][29][30] especially in humans.[31][32][33][34] while humans are known to have sex characteristics that diverge from \"true male\" or \"true female,\" these individuals fall under the social umbrella of intersex conditions and traits, and typically consider the term \"hermaphrodite\" to be a slur when applied to them.[35][36][37]\\n\\nlegislation\\nthe human chimera prohibition act\\non 11 july 2005, a bill known as the human chimera prohibition act was introduced into the united states congress by senator samuel brownback; however, it died in congress sometime in the next year. the bill was introduced based on findings that science has progressed to the point where human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. because of this, ethical issues may arise as the line blurs between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. the final claim brought up in the human chimera prohibition act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases. with that being said, the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.[38]\\n\\non 22 august 2016, another bill, the human-animal chimera prohibition act of 2016, was introduced to the united states house of representatives by christopher h. smith. it identifies a chimera as:\\n\\na human embryo into which a nonhuman cell or cells (or the component parts thereof) have been introduced to render the embryo\\'s membership in the species homo sapiens uncertain;\\na chimera human/animal embryo produced by fertilizing a human egg with nonhuman sperm;\\na chimera human/animal embryo produced by fertilizing a nonhuman egg with human sperm;\\nan embryo produced by introducing a nonhuman nucleus into a human egg;\\nan embryo produced by introducing a human nucleus into a nonhuman egg;\\nan embryo containing at least haploid sets of chromosomes from both a human and a nonhuman life form;\\na nonhuman life form engineered such that human gametes develop within the body of a nonhuman life form; or\\na nonhuman life form engineered such that it contains a human brain or a brain derived wholly or predominantly from human neural tissues.\\nthe bill prohibits the attempts to create a human-animal chimera, the transfer or attempt to transfer a human embryo into a nonhuman womb, the transfer or attempt to transfer a nonhuman embryo into a human womb, and the transport or receive of any purpose of an animal chimera. penalties for violations of this bill include fines and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years. the bill was referred to the subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations on october 11, 2016, but died there.[39]\\n\\npatenting\\nin the u.s., efforts into creating a chimeric entity appeared to be legal when the topic first came up. developmental biologist stuart newman, a professor at new york medical college in valhalla, n.y., applied for a patent on a human-animal chimera in 1997 as a challenge to the u.s. patent and trademark office and the u.s. congress, motivated by his moral and scientific opposition to the notion that living things can be patented at all. prior legal precedent had established that genetically engineered entities, in general, could be patented, even if they were based on beings occurring in nature.[40] after a seven-year process, newman\\'s patent finally received a flat rejection. the legal process had created a paper trail of arguments, giving newman what he claimed was a victory. the washington post ran an article on the controversy that stated that it had raised \"profound questions about the differences-- and similarities-- between humans and other animals, and the limits of treating animals as property.\"[40]\\n\\nreferences\\n sarah taddeo, jason s. robert (2014-11-04). \"\"hybrids and chimeras: a consultation on the ethical and social implications of creating human/animal embryos in research\" (2007), by the hfea\". the embryo project at arizona state university.\\n rinkevich, b.

       " 'computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.[1][2][3] computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).[4][5][6] though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.[7]\\n\\nalgorithms and data structures are central to computer science.[8] the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. the fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\\n\\nthe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[2][9][3][10][11] the turing award is

science\".[14]\\n\\ncharles babbage is sometimes referred to as the \"father of computing\".[15]\\n\\nada lovelace published the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer.[16]\\nthe earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.[17]\\n\\nwilhelm schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623.[18] in 1673, gottfried leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the stepped reckoner.[19] leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. in 1820, thomas de colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry[note 1] when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. charles babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his difference engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his analytical engine.[20] he started developing this machine in 1834, and \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\".[21] \"a crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the jacquard loom\"[21] making it infinitely programmable.[note 2] in 1843, during the translation of a french article on the analytical engine, ada lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.[22] around 1885, herman hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of ibm. following babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, percy ludgate in 1909 published[23] the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. in 1914, the spanish engineer leonardo torres quevedo published his essays on automatics,[24] and designed, inspired by babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read-only program. the paper also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic.[25][26] in 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, torres presented in paris the electromechanical arithmometer, a prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine,[27] on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically.[28] in 1937, one hundred years after babbage\\'s impossible dream, howard aiken convinced ibm, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business[29] to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ascc/harvard mark i, based on babbage\\'s analytical engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. when the machine was finished, some hailed it as \"babbage\\'s dream come true\".[30]\\n\\nduring the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the atanasoff–berry computer and eniac, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.[31] as it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general. in 1945, ibm founded the watson scientific computing laboratory at columbia university in new york city. the renovated fraternity house on manhattan\\'s west side was ibm\\'s first laboratory devoted to pure science. the lab is the forerunner of ibm\\'s research division, which today operates research facilities around the world.[32] ultimately, the close relationship between ibm and columbia university was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946.[33] computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.[7][34] the world\\'s first computer science degree program, the cambridge diploma in computer science, began at the university of cambridge computer laboratory in 1953. the first computer science department in the united states was formed at purdue university in 1962.[35] since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.\\nsee also: history of computing and history of informatics\\netymology\\nsee also: informatics § etymology\\nalthough first proposed in 1956,[36] the term \"computer science\" appears in a 1959 article in communications of the acm,[37] in which louis fein argues for the creation of a graduate school in computer sciences analogous to the creation of harvard business school in 1921.[38] louis justifies the name by arguing that, like management science, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.[37] his efforts, and those of others such as numerical analyst george forsythe, were rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with purdue in 1962.[39] despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves. because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.[40] certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science, to emphasize precisely that difference. danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy,[41] to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. the first scientific institution to use the term was the department of datalogy at the university of copenhagen, founded in 1969, with peter naur being the first professor in datalogy. the term is used mainly in the scandinavian countries. an alternative term, also proposed by naur, is data science; this is now used for a multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.\\n\\nin the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the communications of the acm—turingineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathematician, and applied epistemologist.[42] three months later in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed next year by hypologist.[43] the term computics has also been suggested.[44] in europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression \"automatic information\" (e.g. \"informazione automatica\" in italian) or \"information and mathematics\" are often used, e.g. informatique (french), informatik (german), informatica (italian, dutch), informática (spanish, portuguese), informatika (slavic languages and hungarian) or pliroforiki (πληροφορική, which means informatics) in greek. similar words have also been adopted in the uk (as in the school of informatics, university of edinburgh).[45] \"in the u.s., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.\"[46]\\n\\na folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—edsger dijkstra, states that \"computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\"[note 3] the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. for example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering, while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems. however, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, earth science, statistics, philosophy, and logic.\\n\\ncomputer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.[7] early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as kurt gödel, alan turing, john von neumann, rózsa péter and alonzo church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra.[36]\\n\\nthe relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term \"software engineering\" means, and how computer science is defined.[47] david parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.[48]\\n\\nthe academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science. both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.\\n\\nphilosophy\\nmain article: philosophy of computer science\\nepistemology of computer science\\ndespite the word \"science\" in its name, there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science,[49] mathematics,[50] or engineering.[51] allen newell and herbert a. simon argued in 1975,\\ncomputer science is an empirical discipline. we would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. nonetheless, they are experiments. each new machine that is built is an experiment. actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.[51]\\n\\nit has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of programs, but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science.[51] proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering.[51] they also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.[51]\\n\\nproponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods.[51] computer scientists edsger w. dijkstra and tony hoare regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical axiomatic systems.[51]\\n\\nparadigms of computer science\\na number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. peter wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.[52] peter denning\\'s working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.[7] amnon h. eden described them as the \"rationalist paradigm\" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning), the \"technocratic paradigm\" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the \"scientific paradigm\" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences,[53] identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence).[54] computer science focuses on methods involved in design, specification, programming, verification, implementation and testing of human-made computing systems.[55]\\n\\nfields\\nthis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. you can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\\nfurther information: outline of computer science\\nas a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.[56][57] csab, formerly called computing sciences accreditation board—which is made up of representatives of the association for computing machinery (acm), and the ieee computer society (ieee cs)[58]—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture. in addition to these four areas, csab also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.[56]\\n\\ncomputer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\\n\\n—\\u200aedsger

computation\\nmain article: theory of computation\\naccording to peter denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, \"what can be automated?\"[3] theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. in an effort to answer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation. the second question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.\\n\\nthe famous p = np? problem, one of the millennium prize problems,[59] is an open problem in the theory

signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.[60] coding theory is the study of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding. codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods.

of programming languages and their individual features. it falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. it is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.\\n\\nformal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.[62] the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. they form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. for industrial use, tool support is required. however, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance. formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.\\n\\n\\t\\nγ\\n⊢\\n \\n:\\nint\\n\\\\gamma \\\\vdash

software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance. for example software testing, systems engineering, technical debt and software development processes.\\n\\nartificial intelligence\\nmain articles: artificial intelligence and bio-inspired computing\\nartificial intelligence (ai) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. from its origins in cybernetics and in the dartmouth conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. ai is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding. the starting point in the late 1940s was alan turing\\'s question \"can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. but the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application

the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. it focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.[65] computer engineers study computational logic and design of computer hardware, from individual processor components, microcontrollers, personal computers to supercomputers and embedded systems. the term \"architecture\" in computer literature can be traced to the work of lyle r. johnson and frederick p. brooks, jr., members of the machine organization department in ibm\\'s main

science) and distributed computing\\nconcurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other.[66] a number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including petri nets, process calculi and the parallel random access machine model.[67] when multiple computers are connected in a network while using concurrency, this is known as a distributed system. computers within that distributed system have their own private memory, and information can be exchanged to achieve common goals.[68]\\n\\ncomputer networks\\nmain article: computer network\\nthis branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.\\n\\ncomputer security and cryptography\\nmain

scientific study of problems relating to distributed computations that can be attacked.[69] technologies studied in modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key-agreement protocols, blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and garbled circuits.\\n\\ndatabases and data mining\\nmain articles: database and data mining\\na database is

science:[70]\\n\\ngottfried wilhelm leibniz\\'s, george boole\\'s, alan turing\\'s, claude shannon\\'s, and samuel morse\\'s insight: there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".[note 4]\\nall the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.).\\nsee also: digital physics\\nalan turing\\'s insight: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".\\nevery algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:[71]\\nmove left one location;\\nmove right one location;\\nread symbol at current location;\\nprint 0 at current location;\\nprint 1 at current location.\\nsee also: turing machine\\ncorrado böhm and giuseppe jacopini\\'s insight: there are only three ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do \"anything\".[72]\\nonly three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:\\nsequence: first do this, then do that;\\nselection: if such-and-such is the case, then do this, else do that;\\nrepetition: while such-and-such is the case, do this.\\nthe three rules of boehm\\'s and jacopini\\'s insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (which means it is more elementary than structured programming).\\nsee also: structured program theorem\\nprogramming paradigms\\nmain article: programming paradigm\\nprogramming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. common programming paradigms include:\\n\\nfunctional programming, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. it is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.[73]\\nimperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program\\'s state.[74] in much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\\nobject-oriented programming, a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. a feature of objects is that an object\\'s procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.[75]\\nservice-oriented programming, a programming paradigm that uses \"services\" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programs\\nmany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.[76]\\n\\nresearch\\nfurther information: list of computer science conferences and category:computer science journals\\nconferences are important events for computer science research. during these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications.[77][78] one proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.[79]\\n\\neducation\\nmain article: computer science education\\ncomputer science, known by its near synonyms, computing, computer studies, has been taught in uk schools since the days of batch processing, mark sensitive cards and paper tape but usually to a select few students.[80] in 1981, the bbc produced a micro-computer and classroom network and computer studies became common for gce o level students (11–16-year-old), and computer science to a level students. its importance was recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the national curriculum, for key stage 3 & 4. in september 2014 it became an entitlement for all pupils over the age of 4.[81]\\n\\nin the us, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum, provision was fractured.[82] according to a 2010 report by the association for computing machinery (acm) and computer science teachers association (csta), only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.[83] according to a 2021 report, only 51% of high schools in the us offer computer science.[84]\\n\\nisrael, new zealand, and south korea have included computer science in their national secondary education curricula,[85][86] and several others

related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. these topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,[1] algebra,[2] geometry,[1] and analysis,[3][4] respectively. there is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.\\n\\nmost mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. these objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. a proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. these results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.[5]\\n\\nmathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences. although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications.[6][7] the problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to euclid in 300 bc, had no practical application before its use in the rsa cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks.\\n\\nhistorically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in greek mathematics, most notably in euclid\\'s elements.[8] since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra[a] and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas. since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid lockstep increase in the development of both.[9] at the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method,[10] which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. the contemporary mathematics subject classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.\\n\\netymology\\nthe word mathematics comes from ancient greek máthēma (μάθημα), meaning \"that which is learnt\",[11] \"what one gets to know\", hence also \"study\" and \"science\". the word came to have the narrower and more technical meaning of \"mathematical study\" even in classical times.[12] its adjective is mathēmatikós (μαθηματικός), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studious\", which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\".[13] in particular, mathēmatikḗ tékhnē (μαθηματικὴ τέχνη; latin: ars mathematica) meant \"the mathematical art\".[11]\\n\\nsimilarly, one of the two main schools of thought in pythagoreanism was known as the mathēmatikoi (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant \"learners\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense. the pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. by the time of aristotle (384–322 bc) this meaning was fully established.[14]\\n\\nin latin, and in english until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. this change has resulted in several mistranslations: for example, saint augustine\\'s warning that christians should beware of mathematici, meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[15]\\n\\nthe apparent plural form in english goes back to the latin neuter plural mathematica (cicero), based on the greek plural ta mathēmatiká (τὰ μαθηματικά) and means roughly \"all things mathematical\", although it is plausible that english borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, inherited from greek.[16] in english, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. it is often shortened to maths or, in north america, math.[17]\\n\\nareas of mathematics\\nbefore the renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes.[18] some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.[19]\\n\\nduring the renaissance, two more areas appeared. mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. this division into four main areas–arithmetic, geometry, algebra, calculus[20]–endured until the end of the 19th century. areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics.[21] the subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.[22]\\n\\nat the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics.[23][10] the 2020 mathematics subject classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas.[24] some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. several other first-level areas have \"geometry\" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations.[25]\\n\\nnumber theory\\nmain article: number theory\\n\\nthis is the ulam spiral, which illustrates the distribution of prime numbers. the dark diagonal lines in the spiral hint at the hypothesized approximate independence between being prime and being a value of a quadratic polynomial, a conjecture now known as hardy and littlewood\\'s conjecture f.\\nnumber theory began with the manipulation of numbers, that is, natural numbers \\n(\\n�\\n)\\n,\\n{\\\\displaystyle (\\\\mathbb {n} ),} and later expanded to integers \\n(\\n�\\n)\\n{\\\\displaystyle (\\\\mathbb {z} )} and rational numbers \\n(\\n�\\n)\\n.\\n{\\\\displaystyle (\\\\mathbb {q} ).} number theory was once called arithmetic, but nowadays this term is mostly used for numerical calculations.[26] number theory dates back to ancient babylon and probably china. two prominent early number theorists were euclid of ancient greece and diophantus of alexandria.[27] the modern study of number theory in its abstract form is largely attributed to pierre de fermat and leonhard euler. the field came to full fruition with the contributions of adrien-marie legendre and carl friedrich gauss.[28]\\n\\nmany easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods, often from across mathematics. a prominent example is fermat\\'s last theorem. this conjecture was stated in 1637 by pierre de fermat, but it was proved only in 1994 by andrew wiles, who used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry, category theory, and homological algebra.[29] another example is goldbach\\'s conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. stated in 1742 by christian goldbach, it remains unproven despite considerable effort.[30]\\n\\nnumber theory includes several subareas, including analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, geometry of numbers (method oriented), diophantine equations, and transcendence theory (problem oriented).[25]\\n\\ngeometry\\nmain article: geometry\\n\\non the surface of a sphere, euclidean geometry only applies as a local approximation. for larger scales the sum of the angles of a triangle is not equal to 180°.\\ngeometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. it started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields.[31]\\n\\na fundamental innovation was the ancient greeks\\' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be proved. for example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements. the basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). this principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by euclid around 300 bc in his book elements.[32][33]\\n\\nthe resulting euclidean geometry is the study of shapes and their arrangements constructed from lines, planes and circles in the euclidean plane (plane geometry) and the three-dimensional euclidean space.[b][31]\\n\\neuclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when rené descartes introduced what is now called cartesian coordinates. this constituted a major change of paradigm: instead of defining real numbers as lengths of line segments (see number line), it allowed the representation of points using their coordinates, which are numbers. algebra (and later, calculus) can thus be used to solve geometrical problems. geometry was split into two new subfields: synthetic geometry, which uses purely geometrical methods, and analytic geometry, which uses coordinates systemically.[34]\\n\\nanalytic geometry allows the study of curves unrelated to circles and lines. such curves can be defined as the graph of functions, the study of which led to differential geometry. they can also be defined as implicit equations, often polynomial equations (which spawned algebraic geometry). analytic geometry also makes it possible to consider euclidean spaces of higher than three dimensions.[31]\\n\\nin the 19th century, mathematicians discovered non-euclidean geometries, which do not follow the parallel postulate. by questioning that postulate\\'s truth, this discovery has been viewed as joining russell\\'s paradox in revealing the foundational crisis of mathematics. this aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the axiomatic method, and adopting that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical problem.[35][10] in turn, the axiomatic method allows for the study of various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that do not change under specific transformations of the space.[36]\\n\\ntoday\\'s subareas of geometry include:[25]\\n\\nprojective geometry, introduced in the 16th century by girard desargues, extends euclidean geometry by adding points at infinity at which parallel lines intersect. this simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines.\\naffine geometry, the study of properties relative

formula, which concisely expresses the solutions of all quadratic equations\\n\\nthe rubik\\'s cube group is a concrete application of group theory.[37]\\nalgebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. diophantus (3rd century) and al-khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra.[38][39] diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution. al-khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side. the term algebra is derived from the arabic word al-jabr meaning \\'the reunion of broken parts\\'[40] that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise.\\n\\nalgebra became an area in its own right only with françois viète (1540–1603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers.[41] variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas.\\n\\nuntil the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently linear algebra), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called algebraic equations (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). during the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as matrices, modular integers, and geometric transformations), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid.[42] the concept of algebraic structure addresses this, consisting of a set whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. the scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. this object of algebra was called modern algebra or abstract algebra, as established by the influence and works of emmy noether.[43] (the latter term appears mainly in an educational context, in opposition to elementary algebra, which is concerned with the older way of manipulating formulas.)\\n\\nsome types of algebraic structures have useful and often fundamental properties, in many areas of mathematics. their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include:[25]\\n\\ngroup theory;\\nfield theory;\\nvector spaces, whose study is essentially the same as linear algebra;\\nring theory;\\ncommutative algebra, which is the study of commutative rings, includes the study of polynomials, and is a foundational part of algebraic geometry;\\nhomological algebra;\\nlie algebra and lie group theory;\\nboolean algebra, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of computers.\\nthe study of types of algebraic structures as mathematical objects is the purpose of universal algebra and category theory.[44] the latter applies to every mathematical structure (not only algebraic ones). at its origin, it was introduced, together with homological algebra for allowing the algebraic study of non-algebraic objects such as topological spaces; this particular area of application is called algebraic topology.[45]\\n\\ncalculus and analysis\\nmain articles: calculus and mathematical analysis\\n\\na cauchy sequence consists of elements such that all subsequent terms of a term become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses (from left to right).\\ncalculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians newton and leibniz.[46] it is fundamentally the study of the relationship of variables that depend on each other. calculus was expanded in the 18th century by euler with the introduction of the concept of a function and many other results.[47] presently, \"calculus\" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and \"analysis\" is commonly used for advanced parts.\\n\\nanalysis is further subdivided into real analysis, where variables represent real numbers, and complex analysis, where variables represent complex numbers. analysis includes many subareas shared by other areas of mathematics which include:[25]\\n\\nmultivariable calculus\\nfunctional analysis, where variables represent varying functions;\\nintegration, measure theory and potential theory, all strongly related with probability theory on a continuum;\\nordinary differential equations;\\npartial differential equations;\\nnumerical analysis, mainly devoted to the computation on computers of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in many applications.\\ndiscrete mathematics\\nmain article: discrete mathematics\\n\\na diagram representing a two-state markov chain. the states are represented by \\'a\\' and \\'e\\'. the numbers are the probability of flipping the state.\\ndiscrete mathematics, broadly speaking, is the study of individual, countable mathematical objects. an example is the set of all integers.[48] because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply.[c] algorithms—especially their implementation and computational complexity—play a major role in discrete mathematics.[49]\\n\\nthe four color theorem and optimal sphere packing were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century.[50] the p versus np problem, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of computationally difficult problems.[51]\\n\\ndiscrete mathematics includes:[25]\\n\\ncombinatorics, the art of enumerating mathematical objects that satisfy some given constraints. originally, these objects were elements or subsets of a given set; this has been extended to various objects, which establishes a strong link between combinatorics and other parts of discrete mathematics. for example, discrete geometry includes counting configurations of geometric shapes\\ngraph theory and hypergraphs\\ncoding theory, including error correcting codes and a part of cryptography\\nmatroid theory\\ndiscrete geometry\\ndiscrete probability distributions\\ngame theory (although continuous games are also studied, most common games, such as chess and poker are discrete)\\ndiscrete optimization, including combinatorial optimization, integer programming, constraint programming\\nmathematical logic and set theory\\nmain articles: mathematical logic and set theory\\n\\nthe venn diagram is a commonly used method to illustrate the relations between sets.\\nthe two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century.[52][53] before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians.[54]\\n\\nbefore cantor\\'s study of infinite sets, mathematicians were reluctant to consider actually infinite collections, and considered infinity to be the result of endless enumeration. cantor\\'s work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets[55] but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per cantor\\'s diagonal argument. this led to the controversy over cantor\\'s set theory.[56]\\n\\nin the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring mathematical rigour. examples of such intuitive definitions are \"a set is a collection of objects\", \"natural number is what is used for counting\", \"a point is a shape with a zero length in every direction\", \"a curve is a trace left by a moving point\", etc.\\n\\nthis became the foundational crisis of mathematics.[57] it was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory. roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have.[23] for example, in peano arithmetic, the natural numbers are defined by \"zero is a number\", \"each number has a unique successor\", \"each number but zero has a unique predecessor\", and some rules of reasoning.[58] this mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism, as founded by david hilbert around 1910.[59]\\n\\nthe \"nature\" of the objects defined this way is a philosophical problem that mathematicians leave to philosophers, even if many mathematicians have opinions on this nature, and use their opinion—sometimes called \"intuition\"—to guide their study and proofs. the approach allows considering \"logics\" (that is, sets of allowed deducing rules), theorems, proofs, etc. as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. for example, gödel\\'s incompleteness theorems assert, roughly speaking that, in every consistent formal system that contains the natural numbers, there are theorems that are true (that is provable in a stronger system), but not provable inside the system.[60] this approach to the foundations of mathematics was challenged during the first half of the 20th century by mathematicians led by brouwer, who promoted intuitionistic logic, which explicitly lacks the law of excluded middle.[61][62]\\n\\nthese problems and debates led to a wide expansion of mathematical logic, with subareas such as model theory (modeling some logical theories inside other theories), proof theory, type theory, computability theory and computational complexity theory.[25] although these aspects of mathematical logic were introduced before the rise of computers, their use in compiler design, program certification, proof assistants and other aspects of computer science, contributed in turn to the expansion of these logical theories.[63]\\n\\nstatistics and other decision sciences\\nmain articles: statistics and probability theory\\n\\nwhatever the form of a random population distribution (μ), the sampling mean (x̄) tends to a gaussian distribution and its variance (σ) is given by the central limit theorem of probability theory.[64]\\nthe field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods especially probability theory. statisticians generate data with random sampling or randomized experiments.[65] the design of a statistical sample or experiment determines the analytical methods that will be used. analysis of data from observational studies is done using statistical models and the theory of inference, using model selection and estimation. the models and consequential predictions should then be tested against new data.[d]\\n\\nstatistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. in these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints. for example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[66] because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.[67]\\n\\ncomputational mathematics\\nmain article: computational mathematics\\ncomputational mathematics is the study of mathematical problems that are typically too large for human, numerical capacity.[68][69] numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis broadly includes the study of approximation and discretization with special focus on rounding errors.[70] numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic-matrix-and-graph theory. other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.\\n\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of mathematics\\nancient\\nthe history of mathematics is an ever-growing series of abstractions. evolutionarily speaking, the first abstraction to ever be discovered, one shared by many animals,[71] was probably that of numbers: the realization that, for example, a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (say) have something in common, namely that there are two of them. as evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also known how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.[72][73]\\n\\n\\nthe babylonian mathematical tablet plimpton 322, dated to 1800 bc\\nevidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 bc, when the babylonians and egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra, and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.[74] the oldest mathematical texts from mesopotamia and egypt are from 2000 to 1800 bc. many early texts mention pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical concept after basic arithmetic and geometry. it is in babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) first appear in the archaeological record. the babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a sexagesimal numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.[75]\\n\\nin the 6th century bc, greek mathematics began to emerge as a distinct discipline and some ancient greeks such as the pythagoreans appeared to have considered it a subject in its own right.[76] around 300 bc, euclid organized mathematical knowledge by way of postulates and first principles, which evolved into the axiomatic method that is used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.[77] his book, elements, is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.[78] the greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be archimedes (c.\\u2009287 – c.\\u2009212 bc) of syracuse.[79] he developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.[80] other notable achievements of greek mathematics are conic sections (apollonius of perga, 3rd century bc),[81] trigonometry (hipparchus of nicaea, 2nd century bc),[82] and the beginnings of algebra (diophantus, 3rd century ad).[83]\\n\\n\\nthe numerals used in the bakhshali manuscript, dated between the 2nd century bc and the 2nd century ad\\nthe hindu–arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium ad in india and were transmitted to the western world via islamic mathematics.[84] other notable developments of indian mathematics include the modern definition and approximation of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series.[85][86]\\n\\nmedieval and later\\n\\na page from al-khwārizmī\\'s algebra\\nduring the golden age of islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on greek mathematics. the most notable achievement of islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. other achievements of the islamic period include advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the arabic numeral system.[87] many notable mathematicians from this period were persian, such as al-khwarismi, omar khayyam and sharaf al-dīn al-ṭūsī.[88] the greek and arabic mathematical texts were in turn translated to latin during the middle ages and made available in europe.[89]\\n\\nduring the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in western europe, with innovations that revolutionized mathematics, such as the introduction of variables and symbolic notation by françois viète (1540–1603), the introduction of logarithms by john napier in 1614, which greatly simplified numerical calculations, especially for astronomy and marine navigation, the introduction of coordinates by rené descartes (1596–1650) for reducing geometry to algebra, and the development of calculus by isaac newton (1642–1726/27) and gottfried leibniz (1646–1716). leonhard euler (1707–1783), the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, unified these innovations into a single corpus with a standardized terminology, and completed them with the discovery and the proof of numerous theorems.\\n\\n\\ncarl friedrich gauss\\nperhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the german mathematician carl gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics.[90] in the early 20th century, kurt gödel transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system—if powerful enough to describe arithmetic—will contain true propositions that cannot be proved.[60]\\n\\nmathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. mathematical discoveries continue to be made to this very day. according to mikhail b. sevryuk, in the january 2006 issue of the bulletin of the american mathematical society, \"the number of papers and books included in the mathematical reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation of mr) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. the overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"[91]\\n\\nsymbolic notation and terminology\\nmain articles: mathematical notation, language of mathematics, and glossary of mathematics\\n\\nan explanation of the sigma (σ) summation notation\\nmathematical notation is widely used in science and engineering for representing complex concepts and properties in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way. this notation consists of symbols used for representing operations, unspecified numbers, relations and any other mathematical objects, and then assembling them into expressions and formulas.[92] more precisely, numbers and other mathematical objects are represented by symbols called variables, which are generally latin or greek letters, and often include subscripts. operation and relations are generally represented by specific symbols or glyphs,[93] such as + (plus), × (multiplication), \\n∫{\\\\textstyle \\\\int } (integral), = (equal), and < (less than).[94] all these symbols are generally grouped according to specific rules to form expressions and formulas.[95] normally, expressions and formulas do not appear alone, but are included in sentences of the current language, where expressions play the role of noun phrases and formulas play the role of clauses.\\n\\nmathematics has developed a rich terminology covering a broad range of fields that study the properties of various abstract, idealized objects and how they interact. it is based on rigorous definitions that provide a standard foundation for communication. an axiom or postulate is a mathematical statement that is taken to be true without need of proof. if a mathematical statement has yet to be proven (or disproven), it is termed a conjecture. through a series of rigorous arguments employing deductive reasoning, a statement that is proven to be true becomes a theorem. a specialized theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem is called a lemma. a proven instance that forms part of a more general finding is termed a corollary.[96]\\n\\nnumerous technical terms used in mathematics are neologisms, such as polynomial and homeomorphism.[97] other technical terms are words of the common language that are used in an accurate meaning that may differ slightly from their common meaning. for example, in mathematics, \"or\" means \"one, the other or both\", while, in common language, it is either ambiguous or means \"one or the other but not both\" (in mathematics, the latter is called \"exclusive or\"). finally, many mathematical terms are common words that are used with a completely different meaning.[98] this may lead to sentences that are correct and true mathematical assertions, but appear to be nonsense to people who do not have the required background. for example, \"every free module is flat\" and \"a field is always a ring\".\\n\\nrelationship with sciences\\nmathematics is used in most sciences for modeling phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws.[99] the independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model.[100] inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by invalid mathematical concepts, imply the need to change the mathematical model used.[101] for example, the perihelion precession of mercury could only be explained after the emergence of einstein\\'s general relativity, which replaced newton\\'s law of gravitation as a better mathematical model.[102]\\n\\nthere is still a philosophical debate whether mathematics is a science. however, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences. like them, it is falsifiable, which means in mathematics that, if a result or a theory is wrong, this can be proved by providing a counterexample. similarly as in science, theories and results (theorems) are often obtained from experimentation.[103] in mathematics, the experimentation may consist of computation on selected examples or of the study of figures or other representations of mathematical objects (often mind representations without physical support). for example, when asked how he came about his theorems, gauss once replied \"durch planmässiges tattonieren\" (through systematic experimentation).[104] however, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not relying on empirical evidence.[105][106][107][108]\\n\\n\\npure and applied mathematics\\nmain articles: applied mathematics and pure mathematics\\nisaac newton\\ngottfried wilhelm von leibniz\\nisaac newton (left) and gottfried wilhelm leibniz developed infinitesimal calculus.\\nuntil the 19th century, the development of mathematics in the west was mainly motivated by the needs of technology and science, and there was no clear distinction between pure and applied mathematics.[109] for example, the natural numbers and arithmetic were introduced for the need of counting, and geometry was motivated by surveying, architecture and astronomy. later, isaac newton introduced infinitesimal calculus for explaining the movement of the planets with his law of gravitation. moreover, most mathematicians were also scientists, and many scientists were also mathematicians.[110] however, a notable exception occurred with the tradition of pure mathematics in ancient greece.[111]\\n\\nin the 19th century, mathematicians such as karl weierstrass and richard dedekind increasingly focused their research on internal problems, that is, pure mathematics.[109][112] this led to split mathematics into pure mathematics and applied mathematics, the latter being often considered as having a lower value among mathematical purists. however, the lines between the two are frequently blurred.[113]\\n\\nthe aftermath of world war ii led to a surge in the development of applied mathematics in the us and elsewhere.[114][115] many of the theories developed for applications were found interesting from the point of view of pure mathematics, and many results of pure mathematics were shown to have applications outside mathematics; in turn, the study of these applications may give new insights on the \"pure theory\".[116][117]\\n\\nan example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by laurent schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis.[118] an example of the second case is the decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by alfred tarski, with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high.[119] for getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, george collins introduced the cylindrical algebraic decomposition that became a fundamental tool in real algebraic geometry.[120]\\n\\nin the present day, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a question of personal research aim of mathematicians than a division of mathematics into broad areas.[121][122] the mathematics subject classification has a section for \"general applied mathematics\" but does not mention \"pure mathematics\".[25] however, these terms are still used in names of some university departments, such as at the faculty of mathematics at the university of cambridge.\\n\\nunreasonable effectiveness\\nthe unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist eugene wigner.[7] it is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the \"purest\") have applications outside their initial object. these applications may be completely outside their initial area of mathematics, and may concern physical phenomena that were completely unknown when the mathematical theory was introduced.[123] examples of unexpected applications of mathematical theories can be found in many areas of mathematics.\\n\\na notable example is the prime factorization of natural numbers that was discovered more than 2,000 years before its common use for secure internet communications through the rsa cryptosystem.[124] a second historical example is the theory of ellipses. they were studied by the ancient greek mathematicians as conic sections (that is, intersections of cones with planes). it is almost 2,000 years later that johannes kepler discovered that the trajectories of the planets are ellipses.[125]\\n\\nin the 19th century, the internal development of geometry (pure mathematics) led to definition and study of non-euclidean geometries, spaces of dimension higher than three and manifolds. at this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century, albert einstein developed the theory of relativity that uses fundamentally these concepts. in particular, spacetime of special relativity is a non-euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of general relativity is a (curved) manifold of dimension four.[126][127]\\n\\na striking aspect of the interaction between mathematics and physics is when mathematics drives research in physics. this is illustrated by the discoveries of the positron and the baryon \\nω\\n−\\n.\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\omega ^{-}.} in both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown particle, and the search for these particles. in both cases, these particles were discovered a few years later by specific experiments.[128][129][130]\\n\\nspecific sciences\\n\\nthis subsection needs additional citations for verification. please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this

mathematics in several ways. theoretical computer science is essentially mathematical in nature. communication technologies apply branches of mathematics that may be very old (e.g., arithmetic), especially with respect to transmission security, in cryptography and coding theory. discrete mathematics is useful in many areas of computer science, such as complexity theory, information theory, graph theory, and so on.[citation needed]\\n\\nin return, computing has also become essential for obtaining new results. this is a group of techniques known as experimental mathematics, which is the use of experimentation to discover mathematical insights.[133] the most well-known example is the four-color theorem, which was proven in 1976 with the help of a computer. this revolutionized traditional mathematics, where the rule was that the mathematician should verify each part of the proof. in 1998, the kepler conjecture on sphere packing seemed to also be partially proven by computer. an international team had since worked on writing a formal proof; it was finished (and verified) in 2015.[134]\\n\\nonce written formally, a proof can be verified using a program called a

perfect information.[146][better source needed] this atomistic view of economics allows it to relatively easily mathematize its thinking, because individual calculations are transposed into mathematical calculations. such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms which would be very difficult to discover by a \"literary\" analysis.[citation needed] for example, explanations of economic cycles are not trivial. without mathematical modeling, it is hard to go beyond simple statistical observations or unproven speculation.[citation needed]\\n\\nhowever, many people have rejected or criticized the concept of homo economicus.[146][better source needed] economists note that real people usually have limited information and often make poor choices.[146][better source needed] also, as shown in laboratory experiments, people care about fairness and sometimes altruism, not just personal gain.[146][better source needed] according to critics, mathematization is a veneer that allows for the material\\'s scientific valorization.[citation needed]\\n\\nat the start of the 20th century, there was a movement to express historical movements in formulas.[citation needed] in 1922, nikolai kondratiev discerned the ~50-year-long kondratiev cycle, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis.[147] towards the end of the 19th century, nicolas-remi brück [fr] and charles henri lagrange [fr] had extended their analysis into geopolitics. they wanted to establish the historical existence of vast movements that took peoples to their apogee, then to their decline.[148][verification needed] more recently, peter turchin has been working on developing cliodynamics since the 1990s.[149] (in particular, he discovered the turchin cycle, which predicts that violence spikes in a short cycle of ~50-year intervals, superimposed over a longer cycle of ~200–300 years.[150])\\n\\neven so, mathematization of the social sciences is not without danger. in the controversial book fashionable nonsense (1997), sokal and bricmont denounced the unfounded or abusive use of scientific terminology, particularly from mathematics or physics, in the social sciences. the study of complex systems (evolution of unemployment, business capital, demographic evolution of a population, etc.) uses elementary mathematical knowledge. however, the choice of counting criteria, particularly for unemployment, or of models can be subject to controversy.[citation needed]\\n\\nrelationship with astrology and esotericism\\nsome renowned mathematicians have also been considered to be renowned astrologists; for example, ptolemy, arab astronomers, regiomantus, cardano, kepler, or john dee. in the middle ages, astrology was considered a science that included mathematics. in his encyclopedia, theodor zwinger wrote that astrology was a mathematical science that studied the \"active movement of bodies as they act on other bodies\". he reserved to mathematics the need to \"calculate with probability the influences [of stars]\" to foresee their \"conjunctions and oppositions\".[151]\\n\\nastrology is no longer considered a science.[152]\\n\\nphilosophy\\nmain article: philosophy of mathematics\\nreality\\nthe connection between mathematics and material reality has led to philosophical debates since at least the time of pythagoras. the ancient philosopher plato argued that abstractions that reflect material reality have themselves a reality that exists outside space and time. as a result, the philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist on their own in abstraction is often referred to as platonism. independently of their possible philosophical opinions, modern mathematicians may be generally considered as platonists, since they think of and talk of their objects of study as real objects.[153]\\n\\narmand borel summarized this view of mathematics reality as follows, and provided quotations of g. h. hardy, charles hermite, henri poincaré and albert einstein that support his views.[128]\\n\\nsomething becomes objective (as opposed to \"subjective\") as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together.[154] because the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. in my opinion, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics ...\\n\\nnevertheless, platonism and the concurrent views on abstraction do not explain the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.[155]\\n\\nproposed definitions\\nmain article: definitions of mathematics\\nthere is no general consensus about a definition of mathematics or its epistemological status—that is, its place among other human activities.[156][157] a great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.[156] there is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.[157] some just say, \"mathematics is what mathematicians do\".[156] this makes sense, as there is a strong consensus among them about what is mathematics and what is not. most proposed definitions try to define mathematics by its object of study.[158]\\n\\naristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. however, aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property \"separable in thought\" from real instances set mathematics apart.[159] in the 19th century, when mathematicians began to address topics—such as infinite sets—which have no clear-cut relation to physical reality, a variety of new definitions were given.[160] with the large number of new areas of mathematics that appeared since the beginning of the 20th century and continue to appear, defining mathematics by this object of study becomes an impossible task.\\n\\nanother approach for defining mathematics is to use its methods. so, an area of study can be qualified as mathematics as soon as one can prove theorems—assertions whose validity relies on a proof, that is, a purely-logical deduction.[161] others take the perspective that mathematics is an investigation of axiomatic set theory, as this study is now a foundational discipline for much of modern mathematics.[162]\\n\\nrigor\\nsee also: logic\\nmathematical reasoning requires rigor. this means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the proofs must be reducible to a succession of applications of inference rules,[f] without any use of empirical evidence and intuition.[g][163] rigorous reasoning is not specific to mathematics, but, in mathematics, the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere. despite mathematics\\' concision, rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express. the emergence of computer-assisted proofs has allowed proof lengths to further expand,[h][164] such as the 255-page feit–thompson theorem.[i] the result of this trend is a philosophy of the quasi-empiricist proof that can not be considered infallible, but has a probability attached to it.[10]\\n\\nthe concept of rigor in mathematics dates back to ancient greece, where their society encouraged logical, deductive reasoning. however, this rigorous approach would tend to discourage exploration of new approaches, such as irrational numbers and concepts of infinity. the method of demonstrating rigorous proof was enhanced in the sixteenth century through the use of symbolic notation. in the 18th century, social transition led to mathematicians earning their keep through teaching, which led to more careful thinking about the underlying concepts of mathematics. this produced more rigorous approaches, while transitioning from geometric methods to algebraic and then arithmetic proofs.[10]\\n\\nat the end of the 19th century, it appeared that the definitions of the basic concepts of mathematics were not accurate enough for avoiding paradoxes (non-euclidean geometries and weierstrass function) and contradictions (russell\\'s paradox). this was solved by the inclusion of axioms with the apodictic inference rules of mathematical theories; the re-introduction of axiomatic method pioneered by the ancient greeks.[10] it results that \"rigor\" is no more a relevant concept in mathematics, as a proof is either correct or erroneous, and a \"rigorous proof\" is simply a pleonasm. where a special concept of rigor comes into play is in the socialized aspects of a proof, wherein it may be demonstrably refuted by other mathematicians. after a proof has been accepted for many years or even decades, it can then be considered as reliable.[165]\\n\\nnevertheless, the concept of \"rigor\" may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof.[166]\\n\\ntraining and practice\\neducation\\nmain article: mathematics education\\nmathematics has a remarkable ability to cross cultural boundaries and time periods. as a human activity, the practice of mathematics has a social side, which includes education, careers, recognition, popularization, and so on. in education, mathematics is a core part of the curriculum and forms an important element of the stem academic disciplines. prominent careers for professional mathematicians include math teacher or professor, statistician, actuary, financial analyst, economist, accountant, commodity trader, or computer consultant.[167]\\n\\narchaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium bce in ancient babylonia.[168] comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the ancient near east and then for the greco-roman world starting around 300 bce.[169] the oldest known mathematics textbook is the rhind papyrus, dated from c.\\u20091650 bce in egypt.[170] due to a scarcity of books, mathematical teachings in ancient india were communicated using memorized oral tradition since the vedic period (c.\\u20091500 – c.\\u2009500 bce).[171] in imperial china during the tang dynasty (618–907 ce), a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the civil service exam to join the state bureaucracy.[172]\\n\\nfollowing the dark ages, mathematics education in europe was provided by religious schools as part of the quadrivium. formal instruction in pedagogy began with jesuit schools in the 16th and 17th century. most mathematical curriculum remained at a basic and practical level until the nineteenth century, when it began to flourish in france and germany. the oldest journal addressing instruction in mathematics was l\\'enseignement mathématique, which began publication in 1899.[173] the western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nation-states, with mathematics as a core component—initially for its military applications.[174] while the content of courses varies, in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time.[175]\\n\\nduring school, mathematical capabilities and positive expectations have a strong association with career interest in the field. extrinsic factors such as feedback motivation by teachers, parents, and peer groups can influence the level of interest in mathematics.[176] some students studying math may develop an apprehension or fear about their performance in the subject. this is known as math anxiety or math phobia, and is considered the most prominent of the disorders impacting academic performance. math anxiety can develop due to various factors such as parental and teacher attitudes, social stereotypes, and personal traits. help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches, by interactions with parents and teachers, and by tailored treatments for the individual.[177]\\n\\npsychology (aesthetic, creativity and intuition)\\nthe validity of a mathematical theorem relies only on the rigor of its proof, which could theoretically be done automatically by a computer program. this does not mean that there is no place for creativity in a mathematical work. on the contrary, many important mathematical results (theorems) are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve, and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process.[178][179] an extreme example is apery\\'s theorem: roger apery provided only the ideas for a proof, and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians.[180]\\n\\ncreativity and rigor are not the only psychological aspects of the activity of mathematicians. some mathematicians can see their activity as a game, more specifically as solving puzzles.[181] this aspect of mathematical activity is emphasized in recreational mathematics.\\n\\nmathematicians can find an aesthetic value to mathematics. like beauty, it is hard to define, it is commonly related to elegance, which involves qualities like simplicity, symmetry, completeness, and generality. g. h. hardy in a mathematician\\'s apology expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. he also identified other criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, and inevitability, which contribute to mathematical aesthetic.[182] paul erdős expressed this sentiment more ironically by speaking of \"the book\", a supposed divine collection of the most beautiful proofs. the 1998 book proofs from the book, inspired by erdős, is a collection of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments. some examples of particularly elegant results included are euclid\\'s proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and the fast fourier transform for harmonic analysis.[183]\\n\\nsome feel that to consider mathematics a science is to downplay its artistry and history in the seven traditional liberal arts.[184] one way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematical results are created (as in art) or discovered (as in science).[128] the popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.\\n\\nin the 20th century, the mathematician l. e. j. brouwer even initiated a philosophical perspective known as intuitionism, which primarily identifies mathematics with certain creative processes in the mind.[59] intuitionism is in turn one flavor of a stance known as constructivism, which only considers a mathematical object valid if it can be directly constructed, not merely guaranteed by logic indirectly. this leads committed constructivists to reject certain results, particularly arguments like existential proofs based on the law of excluded middle.[185]\\n\\nin the end, neither constructivism nor intuitionism displaced classical mathematics or achieved mainstream acceptance. however, these programs have motivated specific developments, such as intuitionistic logic and other foundational insights, which are appreciated in their own right.[185]\\n\\ncultural impact\\nglobe icon.\\nthe

he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937. the conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by john howard northrop and wendell meredith stanley, who worked on the digestive enzymes pepsin (1930), trypsin and chymotrypsin. these three scientists were awarded the 1946 nobel prize in chemistry.[17]\\n\\nthe discovery that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures to be solved by x-ray crystallography. this was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by david chilton phillips and published in 1965.[18] this high-resolution structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.[19]\\n\\nclassification and nomenclature\\nenzymes can be classified by two main criteria: either amino acid sequence similarity (and thus evolutionary relationship) or enzymatic activity.\\n\\nenzyme activity. an enzyme\\'s name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in -ase.[1]:\\u200a8.1.3\\u200a examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and dna polymerase. different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.[1]:\\u200a10.3\\u200a\\n\\nthe international union of biochemistry and molecular biology have developed a nomenclature for enzymes, the ec numbers (for \"enzyme commission\"). each enzyme is described by \"ec\" followed by a sequence of four numbers which represent the hierarchy of enzymatic activity (from very general to very specific). that is, the first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism while the other digits add more and more specificity.[20]\\n\\nthe top-level classification is:\\n\\nec 1, oxidoreductases: catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions\\nec 2, transferases: transfer a functional group (e.g. a methyl or phosphate group)\\nec 3, hydrolases: catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds\\nec 4, lyases: cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation\\nec 5, isomerases: catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule\\nec 6, ligases: join two molecules with covalent bonds.\\nec 7, translocases: catalyze the movement of ions or molecules across membranes, or their separation within membranes.\\nthese sections are subdivided by other features such as the substrate, products, and chemical mechanism. an enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. for example, hexokinase (ec 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (ec 2) that adds a phosphate group (ec 2.7) to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (ec 2.7.1).[21]\\n\\nsequence similarity. ec categories do not reflect sequence similarity. for instance, two ligases of the same ec number that catalyze exactly the same reaction can have completely different sequences. independent of their function, enzymes, like any other proteins, have been classified by their sequence similarity into numerous families. these families have been documented in dozens of different protein and protein family databases such as pfam.[22]\\n\\nnon-homologous isofunctional enzymes. unrelated enzymes that have the same enzymatic activity have been called non-homologous isofunctional enzymes.[23] horizontal gene transfer may spread these genes to unrelated species, especially bacteria where they can replace endogenous genes of the same function, leading to hon-homologous gene displacement.\\n\\nstructure\\na graph showing that reaction rate increases exponentially with temperature until denaturation causes it to decrease again.\\nenzyme activity initially increases with temperature (q10 coefficient) until the enzyme\\'s structure unfolds (denaturation), leading to an optimal rate of reaction at an intermediate temperature.\\nsee also: protein structure\\nenzymes are generally globular proteins, acting alone or in larger complexes. the sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme.[24] although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone.[25] enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity.[26] enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species\\' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users for their ability to function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.\\n\\nenzymes are usually much larger than their substrates. sizes range from just 62 amino acid residues, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase,[27] to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase.[28] only a small portion of their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site.[29] this catalytic site is located next to one or more binding sites where residues orient the substrates. the catalytic site and binding site together compose the enzyme\\'s active site. the remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.[30]\\n\\nin some enzymes, no amino acids are directly involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors.[30] enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding of a small molecule causes a conformational change that increases or decreases activity.[31]\\n\\na small number of rna-based biological catalysts called ribozymes exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. the most common of these is the ribosome which is a complex of protein and catalytic rna components.[1]:\\u200a2.2\\u200a\\n\\nmechanism\\nlysozyme displayed as an opaque globular surface with a pronounced cleft which the substrate depicted as a stick diagram snuggly fits into.\\norganisation of enzyme structure and lysozyme example. binding sites in blue, catalytic site in red and peptidoglycan substrate in black. (pdb: 9lyz\\u200b)\\nsubstrate binding\\nenzymes must bind their substrates before they can catalyse any chemical reaction. enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.[32]\\n\\nsome of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and expression of the genome. some of these enzymes have \"proof-reading\" mechanisms. here, an enzyme such as dna polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step.[33] this two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases.[1]:\\u200a5.3.1\\u200a similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in rna polymerase,[34] aminoacyl trna synthetases[35] and ribosomes.[36]\\n\\nconversely, some enzymes display enzyme promiscuity, having broad specificity and acting on a range of different physiologically relevant substrates. many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.[37][38]\\n\\nhexokinase displayed as an opaque surface with a pronounced open binding cleft next to unbound substrate (top) and the same enzyme with more closed cleft that surrounds the bound substrate (bottom)\\nenzyme changes shape by induced fit upon substrate binding to form enzyme-substrate complex. hexokinase has a large induced fit motion that closes over the substrates adenosine triphosphate and xylose. binding sites in blue, substrates in black and mg2+ cofactor in yellow. (pdb: 2e2n\\u200b, 2e2q\\u200b)\\n\"lock and key\" model\\nto explain the observed specificity of enzymes, in 1894 emil fischer proposed that both the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another.[39] this is often referred to as \"the lock and key\" model.[1]:\\u200a8.3.2\\u200a this early model explains enzyme specificity, but fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve.[40]\\n\\ninduced fit model\\nin 1958, daniel koshland suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme.[41] as a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains that make up the active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. in some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site.[42] the active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.[43] induced fit may enhance the fidelity of molecular recognition in the presence of competition and noise via the conformational proofreading mechanism.[44]\\n\\ncatalysis\\nsee also: enzyme catalysis and transition state theory\\nenzymes can accelerate reactions in several ways, all of which lower the activation energy (δg‡, gibbs free energy)[45]\\n\\nby stabilizing the transition state:\\ncreating an environment with a charge distribution complementary to that of the transition state to lower its energy[46]\\nby providing an alternative reaction pathway:\\ntemporarily reacting with the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate to provide a lower energy transition state[47]\\nby destabilising the substrate ground state:\\ndistorting bound substrate(s) into their transition state form to reduce the energy required to reach the transition state[48]\\nby orienting the substrates into a productive arrangement to reduce the reaction entropy change[49] (the contribution of this mechanism to catalysis is relatively small)[50]\\nenzymes may use several of these mechanisms simultaneously. for example, proteases such as trypsin perform covalent catalysis using a catalytic triad, stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an oxyanion hole, complete hydrolysis using an oriented water substrate.[51]\\n\\ndynamics\\nsee also: protein dynamics\\nenzymes are not rigid, static structures; instead they have complex internal dynamic motions – that is, movements of parts of the enzyme\\'s structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. these motions give rise to a conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme\\'s function. for example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle,[52] consistent with catalytic resonance theory.\\n\\nsubstrate presentation\\n\\nthis section needs additional citations for verification. please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (october 2023) (learn how and when to remove this template message)\\nsubstrate presentation is a process where the enzyme is sequestered away from its substrate. enzymes can be sequestered to the plasma membrane away from a substrate in the nucleus or cytosol. or within the membrane, an enzyme can be sequestered into lipid rafts away from its substrate in the disordered region. when the enzyme is released it mixes with its substrate. alternatively, the enzyme can be sequestered near its substrate to activate the enzyme. for example, the enzyme can be soluble and upon activation bind to a lipid in the plasma membrane and then act upon molecules in the plasma membrane.\\n\\nallosteric modulation\\nmain article: allosteric regulation\\nallosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme, distinct from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. these molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme.[53] in this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme\\'s metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux through the rest of the pathway.[54]\\n\\ncofactors\\nthiamine pyrophosphate displayed as an opaque globular surface with an open binding cleft where the substrate and cofactor both depicted as stick diagrams fit into.\\nchemical structure for thiamine pyrophosphate and protein structure of transketolase. thiamine pyrophosphate cofactor in yellow and xylulose 5-phosphate substrate in black. (pdb: 4kxv\\u200b)\\nmain article: cofactor (biochemistry)\\nsome enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity. others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity.[55] cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron–sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). these cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site.[56] organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme\\'s active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).[57]\\n\\nan example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which uses a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site.[58] these tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis.[1]:\\u200a8.1.1\\u200a for example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.[1]:\\u200a17\\u200a\\n\\nenzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. an enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). the term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the dna polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.[1]:\\u200a8.1.1\\u200a\\n\\ncoenzymes\\ncoenzymes are small organic molecules that can be loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another.[59] examples include nadh, nadph and adenosine triphosphate (atp). some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (fmn), flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad), thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp), and tetrahydrofolate (thf), are derived from vitamins. these coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. the chemical groups carried include:\\n\\nthe hydride ion (h−), carried by nad or nadp+\\nthe phosphate group, carried by adenosine triphosphate\\nthe acetyl group, carried by coenzyme a\\nformyl, methenyl or methyl groups, carried by folic acid and\\nthe methyl group, carried by s-adenosylmethionine[59]\\nsince coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. for example, about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme nadh.[60]\\n\\ncoenzymes are usually continuously regenerated and their concentrations maintained at a steady level inside the cell. for example, nadph is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and s-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. this continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. for example, the human body turns over its own weight in atp each day.[61]\\n\\nthermodynamics\\na two dimensional plot of reaction coordinate (x-axis) vs. energy (y-axis) for catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions. the energy of the system steadily increases from reactants (x = 0) until a maximum is reached at the transition state (x = 0.5), and steadily decreases to the products (x = 1). however, in an enzyme catalysed reaction, binding generates an enzyme-substrate complex (with slightly reduced energy) then increases up to a transition state with a smaller maximum than the uncatalysed reaction.\\nthe energies of the stages of a chemical reaction. uncatalysed (dashed line), substrates need a lot of activation energy to reach a transition state, which then decays into lower-energy products. when enzyme catalysed (solid line), the enzyme binds the substrates (es), then stabilizes the transition state (es‡) to reduce the activation energy required to produce products (ep) which are finally released.\\nmain articles: activation energy, thermodynamic equilibrium, and chemical equilibrium\\nas with all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. in the presence of an enzyme, the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly.[1]:\\u200a8.2.3\\u200a for example, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration of its reactants:[62]\\n\\nco\\n2\\n+\\nh\\n2\\no\\n→\\ncarbonic anhydrase\\nh\\n2\\nco\\n3\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {co2{}+h2o->[{\\\\text{carbonic

form the transition state which then decays into products. enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. first, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (es). second, the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (es‡). finally the enzyme-product complex (ep) dissociates to release the products.[1]:\\u200a8.3\\u200a\\n\\nenzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to \"drive\" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. for example, the hydrolysis of atp is often used to drive other chemical reactions.[63]\\n\\nkinetics\\nschematic reaction

between the substrate concentration and reaction rate.\\nmain article: enzyme kinetics\\nenzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products.[64] the rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. in 1913 leonor michaelis and maud leonora menten proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as michaelis–menten kinetics.[65] the major contribution of michaelis and menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. in the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. this is sometimes called the michaelis–menten complex in their honor. the enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. this work was further developed by g. e. briggs and j. b. s. haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.[66]\\n\\nenzyme rates depend on solution conditions and substrate concentration. to find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. this is shown in the saturation curve on the right. saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound es complex. at the maximum reaction rate (vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of es complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.[1]:\\u200a8.4\\u200a\\n\\nvmax is only one of several important kinetic parameters. the amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. this is given by the michaelis–menten constant (km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic km for a given substrate. another useful constant is kcat, also called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.[1]:\\u200a8.4\\u200a\\n\\nthe efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of kcat/km. this is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. the theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (m−1 s−1). at this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase.[1]:\\u200a8.4.2\\u200a the turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.[1]:\\u200a9.2\\u200a but most enzymes are far from perfect: the average values of \\n \\nc\\na\\nt\\n/\\n \\nm\\n{\\\\displaystyle k_{\\\\rm {cat}}/k_{\\\\rm {m}}} and \\n

10{\\\\rm {s}}^{-1}}, respectively.[67]\\n\\nmichaelis–menten kinetics relies on the law of mass action, which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement.[68] more recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.[69]\\n\\ninhibition\\n\\ntwo dimensional representations of the chemical structure of folic acid and methotrexate highlighting the differences between these two substances (amidation of pyrimidone and methylation of secondary amine).\\nthe coenzyme folic acid (left) and the anti-cancer drug methotrexate (right) are very similar in structure (differences show in green). as a result, methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of many enzymes that use folates.\\nmain article: enzyme inhibitor\\nenzyme reaction rates can be decreased by various types of enzyme inhibitors.[70]:\\u200a73–74\\u200a\\n\\ntypes of inhibition\\ncompetitive\\na competitive inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time.[71] often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. for example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate.[72] the similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. this type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. in some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change the shape of the usual binding-site.[73]\\n\\nnon-competitive\\na non-competitive inhibitor binds to a site other than where the substrate binds. the substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence km remains the same. however the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that vmax is reduced. in contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.[70]:\\u200a76–78\\u200a\\n\\nuncompetitive\\nan uncompetitive inhibitor cannot bind to the free enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration. in the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive.[70]:\\u200a78\\u200a this type of inhibition is rare.[74]\\n\\nmixed\\na mixed inhibitor binds to an allosteric site and the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. the enzyme\\'s function is reduced but not eliminated when bound to the inhibitor. this type of inhibitor does not follow the michaelis–menten equation.[70]:\\u200a76–78\\u200a\\n\\nirreversible\\nan irreversible inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme, usually by forming a covalent bond to the protein.[75] penicillin[76] and aspirin[77] are common drugs that act in this manner.\\n\\nfunctions of inhibitors\\nin many organisms, inhibitors may act as part of a feedback mechanism. if an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. this is a form of negative feedback. major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.[1]:\\u200a17.2.2\\u200a\\n\\nsince inhibitors modulate the function of enzymes they are often used as drugs. many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme\\'s native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol,[78] and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as hiv.[79] a common example of an irreversible inhibitor that is used as a drug is aspirin, which inhibits the cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin.[77] other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. for example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.[80]\\n\\nfactors affecting enzyme activity\\nas enzymes are made up of proteins, their actions are sensitive to change in many physio chemical factors such as ph,

transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases.[82] they also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (atp) to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton.[83] other atpases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies.[84] viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the hiv integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.[85]\\n\\nan important function of enzymes is in the digestive systems of animals. enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. different enzymes digest different food substances. in ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.[86]\\n\\nmetabolism\\nschematic diagram of the glycolytic metabolic pathway starting with glucose and ending with pyruvate via several intermediate chemicals. each step in the pathway is catalyzed by a unique enzyme.\\nthe metabolic pathway of glycolysis releases energy by converting glucose to pyruvate via a series of intermediate metabolites. each chemical modification (red box) is performed by a different enzyme.\\nseveral enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways.[1]:\\u200a30.1\\u200a in a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. after the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.[87]\\n\\nenzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps and could not be regulated to serve the needs of the cell. most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of atp. because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to atp hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.[1]:\\u200a30.1\\u200a\\n\\ncontrol of activity\\nthere are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell.[1]:\\u200a30.1.1\\u200a\\n\\nregulation\\nenzymes can be either activated or inhibited by other molecules. for example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration.[88]:\\u200a141–48\\u200a negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells. this helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.[88]:\\u200a141\\u200a\\n\\npost-translational modification\\nexamples of post-translational modification include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation.[88]:\\u200a149–69\\u200a for example, in the response to insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar.[89] another example of post-translational modification is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. this stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. this type of inactive precursor to an enzyme is known as a zymogen[88]:\\u200a149–53\\u200a or proenzyme.\\n\\nquantity\\nenzyme production (transcription and translation of enzyme genes) can be enhanced or diminished by a cell in response to changes in the cell\\'s environment. this form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. for example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule.[90] another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome p450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions.[91] enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.[1]:\\u200a30.1.1\\u200a the opposite of enzyme induction is enzyme repression.\\n\\nsubcellular distribution\\nenzymes can be compartmentalized, with different metabolic pathways occurring in different cellular compartments. for example, fatty acids are synthesized by one set of enzymes in the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and golgi and used by a different set of enzymes as a source of energy in the mitochondrion, through β-oxidation.[92] in addition, trafficking of the enzyme to different compartments may change the degree of protonation (e.g., the neutral cytoplasm and the acidic lysosome) or oxidative state (e.g., oxidizing periplasm or reducing cytoplasm) which in turn affects enzyme activity.[93] in contrast to partitioning into membrane bound organelles, enzyme subcellular localisation may also be altered through polymerisation of enzymes into macromolecular cytoplasmic filaments.[94][95]\\n\\norgan specialization\\nin multicellular eukaryotes, cells in different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have different sets of enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. this provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. for example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration.[96] this enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.[97]\\n\\ninvolvement in disease\\nribbon diagram of phenylalanine hydroxylase with bound cofactor, coenzyme and substrate\\nin phenylalanine hydroxylase over 300 different mutations throughout the structure cause phenylketonuria. phenylalanine substrate and tetrahydrobiopterin coenzyme in black, and fe2+ cofactor in yellow. (pdb: 1kw0\\u200b)\\n\\nhereditary defects in enzymes are generally inherited in an autosomal fashion because there are more non-x chromosomes than x-chromosomes, and a recessive fashion because the enzymes from the unaffected genes are generally sufficient to prevent symptoms in carriers.\\nsee also: genetic disorder\\nsince the tight control of enzyme activity is essential for homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme can lead to a genetic disease. the malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. an example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is tay–sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.[98][99]\\n\\none example of enzyme deficiency is the most common type of phenylketonuria. many different single amino acid mutations in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of phenylalanine, result in build-up of phenylalanine and related products. some mutations are in the active site, directly disrupting binding and catalysis, but many are far from the active site and reduce activity by destabilising the protein structure, or affecting correct oligomerisation.[100][101] this can lead to intellectual disability if the disease is untreated.[102] another example is pseudocholinesterase deficiency, in which the body\\'s ability to break down choline ester drugs is impaired.[103] oral administration of enzymes can be used to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as pancreatic insufficiency[104] and lactose intolerance.[105]\\n\\nanother way enzyme malfunctions can cause disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for dna repair enzymes. defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are less able to repair mutations in their genomes. this causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the development of cancers. an example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.[106][107]\\n\\nevolution\\nsimilar to any other protein, enzymes change over time through mutations and sequence divergence. given their central role in metabolism, enzyme evolution plays a critical role in adaptation. a key question is therefore whether and how enzymes can change their enzymatic activities alongside. it is generally accepted that many new enzyme activities have evolved through gene duplication and mutation of the duplicate copies although evolution can also happen without duplication. one example of an enzyme that has changed its activity is the ancestor of methionyl aminopeptidase (map) and creatine amidinohydrolase (creatinase) which are clearly homologous but catalyze very different reactions (map removes the amino-terminal methionine in new proteins while creatinase hydrolyses creatine to sarcosine and urea). in addition, map is metal-ion dependent while creatinase is not, hence this property was also lost over time.[108] small changes of enzymatic activity are extremely common among enzymes. in particular, substrate binding specificity (see above) can easily and quickly change with single amino acid changes in their substrate binding pockets. this is frequently seen in the main enzyme classes such as kinases.[109]\\n\\nartificial (in vitro) evolution is now commonly used to modify enzyme activity or specificity for industrial applications (see below).\\n\\nindustrial applications\\nmain article: industrial enzymes\\nenzymes are used in the chemical industry and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. enzymes in general are limited in the number of reactions they have evolved to catalyze and also by their lack of stability in organic solvents and at high temperatures. as a consequence, protein engineering is an active area of research and involves attempts to create new enzymes with novel properties, either through rational design or in vitro evolution.[110][111] these efforts have begun to be successful, and a few enzymes have now been designed \"from scratch\" to catalyze reactions that do not occur in nature.[112]\\n\\napplication\\tenzymes used\\tuses\\nbiofuel

[b] savers and investors have money available which could earn interest or dividends if put to productive use. individuals, companies and governments must obtain money from some external source, such as loans or credit, when they lack sufficient funds to run their operations.\\n\\nin general, an entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess, intending to earn a fair return. correspondingly, an entity where income is less than expenditure can raise capital usually in one of two ways: (i) by borrowing in the form of a loan (private individuals), or by selling government or corporate bonds; (ii) by a corporation selling equity, also called stock or shares (which may take various forms: preferred stock or common stock). the owners of both bonds and stock may be institutional investors – financial institutions such as investment banks and pension funds – or private individuals, called private investors or retail investors; see financial market participants.\\n\\nthe lending is often indirect, through a financial intermediary such as a bank, or via the purchase of notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the bond market. the lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.[6][7][8] a bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. a bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. the bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity.\\n\\ninvesting typically entails the purchase of stock, either individual securities or via a mutual fund, for example. stocks are usually sold by corporations to investors so as to raise required capital in the form of \"equity financing\", as distinct from the debt financing described above. the financial intermediaries here are the investment banks. the investment banks find the initial investors and facilitate the listing of the securities, typically shares and bonds. additionally, they facilitate the securities exchanges, which allow their trade thereafter, as well as the various service providers which manage the performance or risk of these investments. these latter include mutual funds, pension funds, wealth managers, and stock brokers, typically servicing retail investors (private individuals).\\n\\ninter-institutional trade and investment, and fund-management at this scale, is referred to as \"wholesale finance\". institutions here extend the products offered, with related trading, to include bespoke options, swaps, and structured products, as well as specialized financing; this \"financial engineering\" is inherently mathematical, and these institutions are then the major employers of \"quants\" (see below). in these institutions, risk management, regulatory capital, and compliance play major roles.\\n\\nareas of finance\\nas outlined, finance comprises, broadly, the three areas of personal finance, corporate finance, and public finance. these, in turn, overlap and employ various activities and sub-disciplines – chiefly investments, risk management, and quantitative finance.\\n\\npersonal finance\\n\\nwealth management consultation – here the financial advisor counsels the client on an appropriate investment strategy\\nmain article: personal finance\\nfurther information: financial planner and investment advisory\\npersonal finance is defined as \"the mindful planning of monetary spending and saving, while also considering the possibility of future risk\".[9] personal finance may involve paying for education, financing durable goods such as real estate and cars, buying insurance, investing, and saving for retirement.[10] personal finance may also involve paying for a loan or other debt obligations. the main areas of personal finance are considered to be income, spending, saving, investing, and protection.[11] the following steps, as outlined by the financial planning standards board,[12] suggest that an individual will understand a potentially secure personal finance plan after:\\n\\npurchasing insurance to ensure protection against unforeseen personal events;\\nunderstanding the effects of tax policies, subsidies, or penalties on the management of personal finances;\\nunderstanding the effects of credit on individual financial standing;\\ndeveloping a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home);\\nplanning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability;\\npursuing a checking or a savings account;\\npreparing for retirement or other long term expenses.[13]\\ncorporate finance\\nmain articles: corporate finance and financial management\\nfurther information: strategic financial management\\ncorporate finance deals with the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. while corporate finance is in principle different from managerial finance, which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone, the concepts are applicable to the financial problems of all firms,[14] and this area is then often referred to as \"business finance\".\\n\\ntypically, then, \"corporate finance\" relates to the long term objective of maximizing the value of the entity\\'s assets, its stock, and its return to shareholders, while also balancing risk and profitability. this entails [15] three primary areas:\\n\\ncapital budgeting: selecting which projects to invest in – here, accurately determining value is crucial, as judgements about asset values can be \"make or break\" [16]\\ndividend policy: the use of \"excess\" funds – are these to be reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders\\ncapital structure: deciding on the mix of funding to be used – here attempting to find the optimal capital mix re debt-commitments vs cost of capital\\nthe latter creates the link with investment banking and securities trading, as above, in that the capital raised will generically comprise debt, i.e. corporate bonds, and equity, often listed shares. re risk management within corporates, see below.\\n\\nfinancial managers – i.e. as distinct from corporate financiers – focus more on the short term elements of profitability, cash flow, and \"working capital management\" (inventory, credit and debtors), ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its financial and operational objectives; i.e. that it: (1) can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments, and (2) has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses. see financial management and financial planning and analysis.\\n\\npublic finance\\n\\npresident george w. bush, speaking on the federal budget in 2007, here requesting additional funds from congress\\n\\ncbo: 2022 us federal budget infographic\\nmain article: public finance\\npublic finance describes finance as related to sovereign states, sub-national entities, and related public entities or agencies. it generally encompasses a long-term strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities.[17] these long-term strategic periods typically encompass five or more years.[18] public finance is primarily concerned with:[19]\\n\\nidentification of required expenditures of a public sector entity;\\nsource(s) of that entity\\'s revenue;\\nthe budgeting process;\\nsovereign debt issuance, or municipal bonds for public works projects.\\ncentral banks, such as the federal reserve system banks in the united states and the bank of england in the united kingdom, are strong players in public finance. they act as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.[20]\\n\\ndevelopment finance, which is related, concerns investment in economic development projects provided by a (quasi) governmental institution on a non-commercial basis;

it is the process of measuring risk and then developing and implementing strategies to manage that risk. financial risk management [24][25] is the practice of protecting corporate value against financial risks, often by \"hedging\" exposure to these using financial instruments. the focus is particularly on credit and market risk, and in banks, through regulatory capital, includes operational risk.\\n\\ncredit risk[26] is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments;\\nmarket risk relates to losses arising from movements in market variables such as prices and exchange rates;\\noperational risk relates to failures in internal processes, people, and systems, or to external events.\\nfinancial risk management is related to corporate finance[14] in two ways. firstly, firm exposure to market risk is a direct result of previous capital investments and funding decisions; while credit risk arises from the business\\'s credit policy and is often addressed through credit insurance and provisioning. secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing or at least preserving, the firm\\'s economic value, and in this context[27] overlaps also enterprise risk management, typically the domain of strategic management. here, businesses devote much time and effort to forecasting, analytics and performance monitoring. see also \"alm\" and treasury management.\\n\\nfor banks and other wholesale institutions,[28] risk management focuses on managing, and as necessary hedging, the various positions held by the institution – both trading positions and long term exposures – and on calculating and monitoring the resultant economic capital, and regulatory capital under basel iii. the calculations here are mathematically sophisticated, and within the domain of quantitative finance as below. credit risk is inherent in the business of banking, but additionally, these institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk. banks typically employ middle office \"risk groups\" here, whereas front office risk teams provide risk \"services\" / \"solutions\" to customers.\\n\\nadditional to diversification – the fundamental risk mitigant here – investment managers will apply various risk management techniques to their portfolios as appropriate:[14] these may relate to the portfolio as a whole or to individual stocks; bond portfolios are typically managed via cash flow matching or immunization. re derivative portfolios (and positions), \"the greeks\" is a vital risk management tool – it measures sensitivity to a small change in a given underlying parameter so that the portfolio can be rebalanced accordingly by including additional derivatives with offsetting characteristics.\\n\\nquantitative finance\\ndōjima rice exchange, the world\\'s first futures exchange, established in osaka in 1697.\\ndōjima rice exchange, the world\\'s first futures exchange, established in osaka in 1697\\nmain article: quantitative analysis (finance)\\nquantitative finance – also referred to as \"mathematical finance\" – includes those finance activities where a sophisticated mathematical model is required,[29] and thus overlaps several of the above.\\n\\nas a specialized practice area, quantitative finance comprises primarily three sub-disciplines;

i.e., it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today, based on the risk and uncertainty of future outcomes while appropriately incorporating the time value of money. determining the present value of these future values, \"discounting\", must be at the risk-appropriate discount rate, in turn, a major focus of finance-theory.[31] as financial theory has roots in many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, economics, physics, and psychology, it can be considered a mix of an art and science,[32] and there are ongoing related efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance.\\n\\nmanagerial finance\\n\\ndecision trees, a more sophisticated valuation-approach, sometimes applied to corporate finance \"project\" valuations (and a standard [33] in business school curricula); various scenarios are considered, and their discounted cash flows are probability weighted.\\nmain article: managerial finance\\nmanagerial finance [34] is the branch of management that concerns itself with the managerial application of finance techniques and theory, emphasizing the financial aspects of managerial decisions; [35] the assessment is per the managerial perspectives of planning, directing, and controlling. the techniques addressed and developed relate in the main to managerial accounting and corporate finance: the former allow management to better understand, and hence act on, financial information relating to profitability and performance; the latter, as above, are about optimizing the overall financial structure, including its impact on working capital. the implementation of these techniques – i.e. financial management – is outlined above. academics working in this area are typically based in business school finance departments, in accounting, or in management science.\\n\\nfinancial economics\\n\\nthe \"efficient frontier\", a prototypical concept in portfolio optimization. introduced in 1952, it remains \"a mainstay of investing and finance\".[36] an \"efficient\" portfolio, i.e. combination of assets, has the best possible expected return for its level of risk (represented by the standard deviation of return).\\n\\nmodigliani–miller theorem, a foundational element of finance theory, introduced in 1958; it forms the basis for modern thinking on capital structure. even if leverage (d/e) increases, the wacc (k0) stays constant.\\nmain article: financial economics\\nfinancial economics [37] is the branch of economics that studies the interrelation of financial variables, such as prices, interest rates and shares, as opposed to real economic variables, i.e. goods and services. it thus centers on pricing, decision making, and risk management in the financial markets,[37][30] and produces many of the commonly employed financial models. (financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.)\\n\\nthe discipline has two main areas of focus: [30] asset pricing and corporate finance; the first being the perspective of providers of capital, i.e. investors, and the second of users of capital; respectively:\\n\\nasset pricing theory develops the models used in determining the risk-appropriate discount rate, and in pricing derivatives; and includes the portfolio- and investment theory applied in asset management. the analysis essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of investment under uncertainty, producing the key \"fundamental theorem of asset pricing\". here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the capm), and to the black–scholes theory for option valuation. at more advanced levels – and often in response to financial crises – the study then extends these \"neoclassical\" models to incorporate phenomena where their assumptions do not hold, or to more general settings.\\nmuch of corporate finance theory, by contrast, considers investment under \"certainty\" (fisher separation theorem, \"theory of investment value\", modigliani–miller theorem). here, theory and methods are developed for the decisioning about funding, dividends, and capital structure discussed above. a recent development is to incorporate uncertainty and contingency – and thus various elements of asset pricing – into these decisions, employing for example real options analysis.\\nfinancial mathematics\\n \\n(\\n \\n,\\n \\n)\\n=\\n \\n(\\n \\n1\\n)\\n \\n−\\n \\n(\\n \\n2\\n)\\n \\n \\n−\\n \\n(\\n \\n−\\n \\n)\\n \\n1\\n=\\n1\\n \\n \\n−\\n \\n[\\nln\\n\\u2061\\n(\\n \\n \\n)\\n+\\n(\\n \\n+\\n \\n2\\n2\\n)\\n(\\n \\n−\\n \\n)\\n]\\n \\n2\\n=\\n \\n1\\n−\\n \\n \\n−\\n \\n{\\\\begin{aligned}c(s,t)&=n(d_{1})s-n(d_{2})ke^{-r(t-t)}\\\\\\\\d_{1}&={\\\\frac {1}{\\\\sigma {\\\\sqrt {t-t}}}}\\\\left[\\\\ln \\\\left({\\\\frac {s}{k}}\\\\right)+\\\\left(r+{\\\\frac {\\\\sigma ^{2}}{2}}\\\\right)(t-t)\\\\right]\\\\\\\\d_{2}&=d_{1}-\\\\sigma {\\\\sqrt {t-t}}\\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}}\\nthe black–scholes formula for the value of a call option. although lately its use is considered naive, it has underpinned the development of derivatives-theory, and financial mathematics more generally, since its introduction in 1973.[38]\\n\\n\"trees\" are widely applied in mathematical finance;

louis bachelier\\'s doctoral thesis, defended in 1900, is considered to be the first scholarly work in this area. the field is largely focused on the modeling of derivatives – with much emphasis on interest rate- and credit risk modeling – while other important areas include insurance mathematics and quantitative portfolio management. relatedly, the techniques developed are applied to pricing and hedging a wide range of asset-backed, government, and corporate-securities.\\n\\nas above, in terms of practice, the field is referred to as quantitative finance and / or mathematical finance, and comprises primarily the three areas discussed. the main mathematical tools and techniques are, correspondingly:\\n\\nfor derivatives,[40] itô\\'s stochastic calculus, simulation, and partial differential equations;

the underlying mathematics comprises mixture models, pca, volatility clustering and copulas.[41]\\nin both of these areas, and particularly for portfolio problems, quants employ sophisticated optimization techniques\\nmathematically, these separate into two analytic branches: derivatives pricing uses risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by \"q\"; while risk and portfolio management generally use physical (or actual or actuarial) probability, denoted by \"p\". these are interrelated through the above \"fundamental theorem of asset pricing\".\\n\\nthe subject has a close relationship with financial economics, which, as outlined, is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics: generally, financial mathematics will derive and extend the mathematical models suggested. computational finance is the branch of (applied) computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance, and especially [39] emphasizes the numerical methods applied here.\\n\\nexperimental finance\\nmain article: experimental finance\\nexperimental finance[42] aims to establish different market settings and environments to experimentally observe and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents\\' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion, and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, as well as attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior of people in artificial, competitive, market-like settings.\\n\\nbehavioral finance\\nmain article: behavioral economics\\nbehavioral finance studies how the psychology of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets [43] [44] and is relevant when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas. with more in-depth research into behavioral finance, it is possible to bridge what actually happens in financial markets with analysis based on financial theory.[45] behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become an integral aspect of finance.[46]\\n\\nbehavioral finance includes such topics as:\\n\\nempirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories;\\nmodels of how psychology affects and impacts trading and prices;\\nforecasting based on these methods;\\nstudies of experimental asset markets and the use of models to forecast experiments.\\na strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed quantitative behavioral finance, which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation.\\n\\nenvironmental finance\\nthis section is an excerpt from environmental finance.[edit]\\nenvironmental finance is a field within finance that employs market-based environmental policy instruments to improve the ecological impact of investment strategies.[47] the primary objective of environmental finance is to regress the negative impacts of climate change through pricing and trading schemes.[48] the field of environmental finance was established in response to the poor management of economic crises by government bodies globally.[49] environmental finance aims to reallocate a businesses resources to improve the sustainability of investments whilst also retaining profit margins.[48]\\nquantum finance\\n\\nthis section does not cite any sources. please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

(herodotus mentions the use of crude coins in lydia in an earlier date, around 687 bc.)[51][52]\\n\\nthe use of coins as a means of representing money began in the years between 600 and 570 bce. cities under the greek empire, such as aegina (595 bce), athens (575 bce), and corinth (570 bce), started to mint their own coins. in the roman republic, interest was outlawed altogether by the lex genucia reforms. under julius caesar, a ceiling on interest rates of 12% was set, and later under justinian it was lowered even further to between 4% and 8%.[53]\\n\\nit is said belgium is the place where the first exchange happened back in approximately 1531.[54] since, popular exchanges such as the london stock exchange (founded in 1773) and the new york stock exchange (founded in 1793) were created.[55][56]\\n\\nsee also\\noutline of finance\\nfinancial crisis of 2007–2010\\nnotes\\n the following are definitions of finance as crafted by the authors indicated:\\nfama and miller: \"the theory of finance is concerned with how individuals and firms allocate resources through time. in particular, it seeks to explain how solutions to the problems faced in allocating resources through time are facilitated by the existence of capital markets (which provide a means for individual economic agents to exchange resources to be available of different points in time) and of firms (which, by their production-investment decisions, provide a means for individuals to transform current resources physically into resources to be available in the future).\"\\nguthmann and dougall: \"finance is concerned with the raising and administering of funds and with the relationships between private profit-seeking enterprise on the one hand and the groups which supply the funds on the other. these groups, which include investors and speculators — that is, capitalists or property owners — as well as those who advance short-term capital, place their money in the field of commerce and industry and in return expect a stream of income.\"\\ndrake and fabozzi: \"finance is the application of economic principles to decision-making that involves the allocation of money under conditions of uncertainty.\"\\nf.w. paish: \"finance may be defined as the position of money at the time it is wanted\".\\njohn j. hampton: \"the term finance can be defined as the management of the flows of money through an organisation, whether it will be a corporation, school, or bank or government agency\".\\nhoward and upton: \"finance may be defined as that administrative area or set of administrative functions in an organisation which relates with the arrangement of each debt and credit so that the organisation may have the means to carry out the objectives as satisfactorily as possible\".\\npablo fernandez: \"finance is a profession that requires interdisciplinary training and can help the managers of companies make sound decisions about financing, investment, continuity and other issues that affect the inflows and outflows of money, and the risk of the company. it also helps people and institutions invest and plan money-related issues wisely.\"\\n finance thus allows production and consumption in society to operate independently from each other. without the use of financial allocation, production would have to happen at the same time and space as consumption. through finance, distances in timespace between production and consumption are then posible.[5]\\nreferences\\n hayes, adam. \"finance\". investopedia. archived from the original on 2020-12-19. retrieved 2022-08-03.\\n gippel, jennifer k (2012-11-07). \"a revolution in finance?\". australian journal of management. 38 (1): 125–146. doi:10.1177/0312896212461034. issn 0312-8962. s2cid 154759424. archived from the original on 2022-08-04. retrieved 2022-08-04.\\n \"finance\" archived 2023-01-31 at the wayback machine, ucas subject guide.\\n anthony p. carnevale, ban cheah, andrew r. hanson (2015). \"the economic value of college majors\" archived 2022-11-08 at the wayback machine. georgetown university.\\n allen, michael;

(august 2022) (learn how and when to remove this template message)\\nthe ghana banking crisis was a severe banking crisis that affected ghana between august 2017 and january 2020. the bank of ghana (bog) allowed several indigenous banks to be taken over by private companies between august 2017 and january 2019 after nana akufo-addo was elected president in december 2016. most of the indigenous banks had been at the risk of defaulting on their loans, as they had been affected by the economic fallout of the great recession, which caused the events leading up to the arab spring that occurred in north africa beginning in 2010. the crisis is the most severe economic crisis to affect ghana since it became an independent country in 1960. the covid-19 pandemic arrived in ghana towards the end of the banking crisis in 2020, dealing further damage to the country\\'s economy.\\n\\nbackground\\non august 14, 2017, the bog in its press release announced its approval for the takeover of two indigenous banks, ut bank ltd and capital bank ltd, by gcb bank ltd.[1] bog cited the insolvency of the banks in question, as the major reason for the revocation of their operation licenses.[2] according to bog, upon several agreements with the banks to increase their capital requirements, managers of the banks failed. consequently, to protect customers, the licenses of the banks were revoked under a purchase and assumption transaction with gcb bank ltd.[3]\\n\\nroughly after a year later, on august 1, 2018, the bog announced the consolidation of five indigenous banks to form a new bank called the consolidated bank ghana ltd. the five collapsed banks included unibank ghana ltd, the royal bank ltd, beige bank ltd, sovereign bank ltd, and construction bank ltd[4] the same reason of insolvency was cited as a cause of the collapse of the various banks.[5] within a span of two years, about seven indigenous banks have collapsed.[6]\\n\\ncauses\\ncorporate governance\\npoor corporate governance has been cited as one of the major causes of the collapse of the seven banks by bog, and other financial analysts.[7] board level and senior management were either inactive or engaged in activities that inured to their personal interests rather than to the growth of the banks. for instance, there was the observation that most of the non-performing loans were advanced to people who were related to senior board managers.[8] furthermore, board of directors of banks failed to oversee bank accounting and corporate reporting systems as well as the external auditing system due to lack of experience or greed.[9] in addition, board of directors failed to provide proper functioning risk management framework. there was also the lack of independence and integrity among chief internal auditors in most of the collapsed banks, leading to cover-ups for executive directors during review processes.[10] the general non-adherence to policies of corporate governance has greatly contributed to the collapse of these banks.[11]\\n\\nnon-performing loans\\nnon-performing loans is another key cause of the collapse of some of the banks. according to bog, the banking sector assets quality remained a major concern as banks\\' stock of non-performing loans and the non-performing loans ratio remained high.[12] it was observed that most of the collapsed banks had huge non-performing loans on their balance sheets.[13] non-performing loans affects the banks in the following way, amongst others: increase in operating costs, leading to decrease in profitability.[14] this has financial ramifications for banks, which may cause capital reduction leading to undercapitalization.\\n\\ncredit risk\\ncredit risk refers to the risk that a borrower will default on a loan obligation to a bank or the issuer of a security held by a bank will default on its obligations.[15] credit risk may arise in cases of inadequate income, loss in business, death, unwillingness and other reasons, on the side of the borrower.[16] large losses generated by defaults of borrowers or issuers of security can lead to insolvency and possibly to the bankruptcy of a bank.[17] it was alleged that there was too much connivance in local banks to pick loans without any recourse to paying back or following appropriate policies.[18] furthermore, due to bad corporate governance, appropriate risk management practices to reduce credit risks such as proper monitoring and measuring mechanisms were not observed in credit deliveries.[19]\\n\\nregulatory lapses\\nregulatory lapses the central bank of ghana is the chief regulator of ghana\\'s banking system. they prescribe the legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector of the country.[20] in its press release statement, bog stated that\\n...regulatory non-compliance, and poor supervision, (questionable licensing processes and weak enforcement) lead to a significant build-up of vulnerabilities in the banking sector.[21]\\n\\nall these responsibilities quoted above, falls within the regulatory and supervisory role of the central bank of ghana.[22] under any circumstance, the regulator is solely responsible for reading the proactive constructs of the provisions made within the laws to protect activities within the sector, in other to prevent situations of dire consequences.[23] 1\\n\\ncauses specific to the various banks\\nut bank ltd\\nloan against collateral\\nin his recently launched book, former ut bank and capital bank employee, samuel okyere, observed that bank loans were granted mainly on loan against collateral principle, the process of lending did not follow strict credit risk best practices. in the same book, fate of system thinking,[24] the author points to a failure that was more systemic, small failures over time that ultimately culminated into the entire banking crisis.[25]\\n\\npoor credit management practices\\na significant cause of bank failure is poor credit quality and deficient credit risk assessment and measurement practices; and therefore, the failure to identify or recognize an increase in credit risks in a timely manner can cause major problems.[26] an observation was made that there was non-adherence to credit management principles and procedures as due to the high exposure of the bank to insiders and related parties.[27] samuel okyere also noted that the loans approval process was run as a closely coupled system and did not allow for diversity and varying opinion which led to confirmation biases.[28] some auditors, boulders advisors limited, in a document stated that their review of \"loans granted to related parties not connected to the ut group\" found out that there were \"poor credit management practices, poor credit governance and supervision\".[29]\\n\\ncapital bank ltd\\ndebt\\ncapital bank was declared insolvent by bog in august 2017. its liabilities greatly exceeded its assets.[30] according to the financial analyst, sydney casely-hayford, noncollectable debts of gh₵11 billion owed to capital bank and ut bank resulted in the collapse of the banks.[31]\\n\\nquestionable license process\\nit was reported that capital bank ltd procured its license under false pretense.[32]\\n\\nbad risk management and funds embezzlement\\na report was made that capital bank collapsed because major shareholder william ato essien treated depositors funds and public funds as though they were his personal funds.[33]\\n\\nthe liquidity support of gh₵620 million, that was issued by the central bank of ghana to capital bank to cure its liquidity struggles was allegedly mismanaged, leading to its collapse.[34]\\n\\nunibank ghana ltd\\nundercapitalization\\naccording to the press release document by central bank of ghana, during its asset quality review (aqr) of banks conducted in 2015, and reviewed in 2016, unibank ghana ltd was identified to be significantly undercapitalized. although the bank subsequently submitted a capital restoration plan to central bank of ghana, the plan failed in returning them back to solvency and compliance to prudential requirement. hence, it was found that the bank was beyond rehabilitation.[35]\\n\\nroyal bank ltd\\nundercapitalization\\nthe updated asset quality review (aqr) of the central bank of ghana revealed that, just as in the case of unibank ghana ltd, royal bank ltd was also significantly under-capitalized, plans to restore them back to solvency could not materialize. hence, royal bank ltd was declared to be beyond rehabilitation.[36]\\n\\nconstruction bank ltd\\nobtaining license under false pretense\\nconstruction bank was granted a provisional license in 2016 and subsequently launched in 2017.[37] according to the central bank of ghana report, it emerged that sovereign bank ltd license was obtained by false pretenses through the use of suspicious and nonexistent capital.[38]\\n\\nreferences\\n communications department (14 august 2017). \"gcb

the economic poster boy of west africa. despite being a major cocoa and gold exporter, it is currently battling its worst financial crisis in decades with inflation hovering at a record 50.3 percent, the highest in 21 years.\\n\\nghana’s economic successes were in the limelight when the new government of president nana akufo-addo took power in january 2017 and brought down inflation significantly. under the previous government in 2016, it was 15.4 percent, and it fell to 7.9 percent by the end of 2019 and remained in single digits until the pandemic hit in march 2020.\\n\\nghana’s budget deficit, which was about 6.5 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product before akufo-addo’s government came to power, was brought down to less than 5 percent of gdp by the end of 2019.\\n\\n“the growth that we experienced around 2017 to 2019 was actually coming from the oil sector,” daniel anim amarteye, an economist with the accra-based policy initiative for economic development, told al jazeera.\\n\\n“we were so excited that the economy was growing, but we couldn’t devise strategies to ensure that the growth reflects in the other sectors of the economy,” he said. “for instance, we neglected the agriculture sector, and we couldn’t do any meaningful value-added investment in that sector. the government became complacent.”\\n\\na man sorts through money\\nghana’s cedi currency lost more than 50 percent of its value in 2022 [file: francis kokoroko/reuters]\\naccording to the united nations’ food and agriculture organization, agriculture represents 21 percent of ghana’s gdp and accounts for more than 40 percent of its export earnings. at the same time, it provides more than 90 percent of the food the country needs.\\n\\n“over the years, the government failed to invest in increasing output in the agricultural sector that will eventually lead to economic growth and transformation and food security. we are a major cocoa growing country, but we didn’t pay attention to increasing yields to translate into more foreign exchange earnings to drive economic growth and employment,” amarteye said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nad\\n\\nsign up for al jazeera\\nweek in the middle

significantly to the economy, mostly buy and sell products they import from western countries and china, including home appliances, consumables, cars and second-hand clothes. due to the nature of their businesses, there is a persistent strong demand for the us dollar to pay for imports. this led to the continuous depreciation of the local currency, the cedi, which was recently described as the worst-performing on world markets.\\n\\nas inflation surges, rising prices keep the cost of living accelerating for ghanaians.\\n\\n“things are not the same any more,” said francis anim, a vehicle spare parts importer. “i used to spend $5 a day with my wife and child on food alone early this year. now we spend close to $10 [for the same amount of food]. why?”\\n\\n“we are feeling the heat,” he said. “the import duties are very high at the ports, so we have to pass on that burden to retailers, and eventually the consumer suffers. this has resulted in a high cost of living in ghana, and the economy is not helping us either.”\\n\\na nation in crisis\\nthe president conceded in a recent address to the nation that the west african country is in crisis. he blamed the situation on external shocks – the pandemic and russia-ukraine war.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nad\\n\\nhowever, analysts say the government took certain political and economic decisions that would have eventually exposed the weaknesses in the system even without those external factors.\\n\\nfor instance, to fulfil one of akufo-addo’s most expensive campaign pledges, his government launched a free education programme in public high schools nine months after he took office. it also provided free meals to students at primary and secondary levels.\\n\\nalso in 2017, the governing new patriotic party scrapped what it called 15 “nuisance taxes”. these included the 17.5 percent value added tax on financial services, real estate and selected imported medicines. they also reduced import duties on spare car parts, abolished the 1 percent special import levy and the 17.5 percent vat on domestic airline tickets.\\n\\n“this brought a massive reduction in government revenue,” williams kwasi peprah, a ghanaian associate professor of finance at andrews university in michigan, told al jazeera. “to make up for the revenue shortfall, the government adopted borrowing. this increased ghana’s bond market activities domestically and externally and, as a result, a high debt-to-gdp exposure, leading to the current debt unsustainability levels.”\\n\\nfrom august 2017 to december 2018, akufo-addo’s government spent more than $2.1bn on what it called the “banking sector cleanup”.\\n\\nadvertisement\\nthe central bank said some banks were insolvent and were operating on life support, putting the interests of depositors at risk. the cleanup saw a reduction in the number of banks from 33 to 23 while more than 340 other financial institutions, such as savings and loans companies, had their licences revoked.\\n\\nthe government aimed to restore confidence and reposition the banking sector to support economic growth.\\n\\nghana's president nana akufo-addo\\nnana akufo-addo became ghana’s president in 2017 and was re-elected in 2020 [file: ludovic marin/ap]\\n“the financial sector cleanup also cost the country more than anticipated in attaining a robust financial sector before 2022,” peprah said.\\n\\nhe said the discovery of two more oilfields in 2019 led to the anticipation of more revenues. the government responded by issuing more domestic and external bonds, increasing its debt and raising spending on interest payments, social programmes and employment.\\n\\nthe government is ghana’s largest employer, primarily in the fields of education, healthcare and security. it spends almost half of its budget on wages; this year, it raked in $8.2bn in estimated revenue and used about $4.2bn to pay salaries of public sector workers.\\n\\nin 2017, the government also restored allowances for trainee nurses and teachers. president john mahama lost to akufo-addo in the 2016 election partly for suspending those allowances two years earlier. they put a huge strain on the public purse. for the nurses’ allowances alone, the government paid more than $2.5 million annually.\\n\\n“that was a poor political and economic decision the akufo-addo government made at that time because the country was faced with revenue challenges,” said kwasi yirenkyi, a financial analyst with accra-based data crunchers. “the government was spending more than it was receiving, and at the same time, it failed to widen the tax net. we were slowly heading for disaster.”\\n\\nadvertisement\\nthe pandemic and debt load\\nthere was a significant drop in revenue in 2020 coupled with a rise in government expenditures. they were mainly covid-related as the government adopted a populist approach, provided free water and electricity to citizens and fed 470,000 households during a three-week lockdown that cost the nation $9.4m.\\n\\nin august 2021 akufo-addo began what he later admitted was “an overly ambitious” construction project of 111 hospitals with an estimated price tag of more than $1bn. pressure kept mounting on his government to fulfil a plethora of other electoral promises, such as the construction of roads, schools and markets, forcing the government to keep borrowing and leaving an economy dogged by high public debt. the most recent data released by the central bank put the country’s debt load at $48.9bn as of september. that represents 76 percent of gdp.\\n\\n“largely, the debt that we accrued were not actually prudently used to drive economic growth,” amarteye said. “if that was done, we could have generated sufficient inflow to be able to meet repayment obligations. borrowing is not a bad thing, but how you use it is critical. on our part, the managers of the economy failed to invest it in the critical sectors of the economy.”\\n\\nthe oil-exporting country produced 39.15 million barrels of crude oil from january to september, according to the 2023 budget statement read by finance minister ken ofori-atta in parliament in november. they brought in $873.25m in revenues for the eighth-largest oil producer in africa. although oil production declined between january and june, according to a report by the public interest and accountability committee, a surge in prices resulted in the government taking in more revenue than it had expected.\\n\\n“where did all the oil revenue go to?” opposition member of parliament isaac adongo asked. “the economy has been on life-support system because this government kept borrowing. we have now hit the ceiling, and there is no way out.”\\n\\nadvertisement\\nin spite of the challenges, the government had been optimistic that the economy would bounce back after the pandemic. however, russia’s war in ukraine has derailed ghana’s economic recovery. the cedi, its currency, lost more than 50 percent of its value between january and october 2022, causing ghana’s debt burden to rise by $6bn.\\n\\npeople on a street in accra, ghana\\nshops in accra were closed by traders in october in protest against ghana’s worsening economic conditions [file: francis kokoroko/reuters]\\n“the war affected global economies and exposed fundamental weaknesses,” peprah said. “within a short period, prices in ghana had increased, leading to hyperinflation and currency devaluation affecting both macro and micro levels of the economy. the bank of ghana did not have the needed dollars to pay for the country’s commitments. the balance of payment had deteriorated, leading ghana to insolvency.”\\n\\nworkers and traders protested from july to september over price hikes, which have increased the cost of electricity by 27 percent and water by 22 percent.\\n\\nactivists and anti-corruption campaigners have also accused the government of mismanaging public finances.\\n\\n“we have gold, oil and cocoa, yet we’re still foundering as a nation,” said bernard mornah, a leading member of the arise ghana pressure group. “the level of corruption under this government is unprecedented. there are so many revenue loopholes that must be blocked. government officials are looting state funds and assets, so how do we develop?”\\n\\na 2021 transparency international study on perceptions of corruption in africa ranked ghana ninth out of 49 sub-saharan african countries.\\n\\ninvestor confidence dims\\ninvestors began to lose confidence in the economy as the government grappled with liquidity challenges. they started moving their money out of ghana. in may, minister ofori-atta introduced an unpopular e-levy, which placed a 1.5 percent tax on all electronic and merchant payments, bank transfers and remittances as part of measures to increase revenue. it brought in a paltry 10 percent of its targeted amount in its first month.\\n\\nadvertisement\\nin the middle of this economic storm, credit ratings firms such as moody’s downgraded ghana to junk status, pushing even more investors away. at this point, ghana was forced in july to turn to the international monetary fund (imf) for relief.\\n\\nit was a difficult decision for akufo-addo to make after he had condemned his predecessor for mismanaging the economy and taking an imf bailout.\\n\\nin december, the government reached an agreement with the imf for a $3bn loan. however, the west african country needs to carry out a comprehensive debt restructuring in order to receive the funds. this means that ghana will have to renegotiate the terms of its debt with its creditors, including extending repayment period, lowering the interest rate, or reducing the overall balance owed.\\n\\nformerly regarded as an investor favourite, ghana has also suspended payments on part of its foreign debt to preserve the fast-depleting international reserve of the central bank. there is also a freeze in hiring into the public sector among many other measures taken to cut expenditure.\\n\\n“the story would have been different but for the pandemic and the russia war in ukraine,” deputy finance minister abena osei-asare said. “we have instituted clear policies to return to economic growth. we are very hopeful the economy will bounce back.”\\n\\na street in ghana\\n‘we have gold, oil and cocoa, yet we’re still foundering as a nation,’ a ghanaian activist said [file: luc gnago/reuters]\\nthe economy has made some gains since ghana reached the agreement with the imf. the cedi is recovering against the us dollar, appreciating by 63.7 percent in mid-december, according to the bank of ghana, after suffering a year-to-date depreciation of 54.2 percent at the end of november. but economists and scholars such as peprah believe the long-term solution is for the government to live within its means.\\n\\n“the solution to the current problem is for the government to reduce expenditure and increase revenue,” peprah said. “it needs to ensure efficient and effective allocation of resources backed by accountability.”\\n\\nadvertisement\\nfor his part, amarteye said the government must be downsized, and he called for stringent measures to check corruption.\\n\\n“we have to ensure that every cedi that is extended to government agencies are accounted for,” amarteye said. “the office of the special prosecutor should be empowered to be able to deal with corruption in the system. there should be fiscal discipline, and also we have to add value to our produce by supporting the private sector to lead that particular space.”\\n\\n“if that is done, jobs will be created and also the economy will bounce back,” he said.\\n\\nin odorkor, shop-owner oduro, like many ghanaians, wants to see a thriving economy again, one in which she can do business and feed her family.\\n\\n“i have played my part as a voter,” she said. “the government must play its part too – fix the economy. this is not

       " '1 introduction\\nwhat started as a financial crisis in july 2007 in the u.s.\\ndegenerated into a full blown global economic crisis in\\nsubsequent months. a financial crisis, also known as a credit\\ncrunch, occurs when there is an uncontrollable reduction in\\nmoney supply and wealth with people losing confidence\\nand refusing to honour their debt obligations. this creates\\ndisincentives for further credit creation, and incites lenders\\nto recall existing loans. it was this phenomenon that was\\nunleashed with loss of confidence by investors in the value\\nof securitised mortgages including default on highly rated\\nfinancial instruments in the united states and the first run\\non a u.k. bank in 150 years. reverberations quickly spread\\nbeyond financial centres in the u.s. and the u.k. to other\\nindustrial countries in the world. what started in the u.s.\\nas a mortgage crisis has degenerated into a global financial\\nand economic crisis that compelled the united states federal\\nreserve, bank of england and the european central bank to\\ninject unprecedented amounts of capital into the financial\\nmarkets. the question that begs itself for an answer is why\\nthis crisis could occur in the 21st century?\\n2 nature of the global economy\\nto fully appreciate the wider global implications of\\nthe crisis, and its impact on the economy of ghana in\\nparticular, it is pertinent to outline the nature of the world\\neconomy, especially the increasing interdependence among\\ncountries on one hand, and the dependence of ldcs on\\nthe industrialised countries in north america and europe\\nas well as the emerging economies as major markets for\\ntheir primary commodities and suppliers of their final and\\nintermediate products. referred to as globalisation, this\\nincreasing interdependence is the process by which the\\npeople of the world are unified into a single society and\\nfunction together as such, in a global village. this global\\nvillage epithet connotes integration of world economic,\\ntechnological, socio-cultural and political forces across\\ncountries, which are reflected in assimilation of national\\neconomies into the international economy through trade,\\nforeign direct investment, capital flows, migration, and\\nthe spread of technology. as a global village, globalisation\\nentails a huge variety of intertwined micro-processes that\\ndenationalise what had been constructed as national. for\\nthe world financial crisis and\\nits implications for ghana\\ndr. fritz augustine gockel\\nparliamentary briefing paper\\n1\\nexample legal and regulatory policies in international finance,\\npolitical subjectivities, urban spaces, temporal frames a\\nvariety of dynamics and domains have all converged across\\ncountries. many production processes, ostensibly, taking\\nplace in the us have in actual fact been dismembered or\\nhave been outsourced to firms across countries including\\nghana where pay checks or parking tickets to people in\\nthe us are issued. the more active a country is in the global\\nvillage, the more severe is the effect of the crisis on that\\ncountry. as we see later, although ghana is undoubtedly\\npart of the global village, its weak interdependency links\\nhave so far shielded it from the frontline effects of the\\ncrisis. to appreciate the full implications of the crisis for\\na developing country such as ghana, it is important to\\nunderstand the “true” causes of the current global financial\\nand economic crisis so as to be able to fashion workable\\nsolutions to addressing the probable impacts of the crisis\\non the economy.\\n3 origins of the crisis\\nthe origins of the crisis lie in complex interaction of a\\nnumber of forces scattered across policy setting and\\nmistakes, market failure and regulatory failure in the\\ndeveloped market economies.\\n3.1 policy setting and mistakes\\nin the case of policy setting and mistakes, the five years\\nleading up to the first visible signs of the crisis in july 2007\\nwere characterised by low real short term policy interest rates\\nfollowing successful reduction in inflation and “disinflation\\nscares” in the us and eu. both short and long term interest\\nrates virtually converged and market participants were able\\nto use both long term and short term credit interchangeably\\nwithout regard to when repayment was due. the market\\nbecame careless as several participants tended to use short\\nterm instruments for long term purposes in the misguided\\nbelief that the short term rates were going to be prolonged.\\nfurthermore, as the system was awash with all types of\\ncredits, and even households that were previously not\\ncreditworthy by acceptable standards (sub-prime borrowers)\\nwere now given the opportunity to borrow heavily. at the\\nsame time, global financial savings exceeded perceived\\ninvestment opportunities, which helped to depress longterm rates across the world. global conditions remained\\naccommodating even when short term rates were increased,\\nthus still keeping real and nominal rates generally low.\\ndeveloping economies were able to build up larger reserves\\nto reduce external vulnerability and maintain stable value\\nof their currencies against the dollar. indeed, ghana was\\nalso able to improve its gross international reserves with\\nmassive foreign inflows and nominal appreciation of the\\ncedi between 2003 and 2006 paving the ground for the\\nredenomination which envisaged a one-to-one parity with\\nthe us dollar on a sustained basis. in june 2004 the us\\nmonetary authorities began to slowly increase its policy\\nrates, which peaked at 5.25% in june 2006. long term\\ninterest rates began to fall with bursting of the housing\\nbubble and a wild gyration of commodity prices as money\\nflowed out of assets like housing or stocks.\\n3.2\\t market failure: rapid financial innovation\\nin the us rapid financial innovation and engineering were\\npromoted, making risk easier to trade and distribute with\\nsecuritisation (the process of aggregating similar financial\\ninstruments, such as loans or mortgages, into a security that\\ncan be sold or transferred or delivered to another party).\\nfinancial assets of all sorts from credit-card to companies’\\ndebt repayments were turned into securities and priced. as\\na result of heavy subprime borrowing, homeownership rate\\nincreased exacerbating house price increases and consumer\\nspending. indications are that between 1997 and 2006,\\nhome prices increased by about 124%. unfortunately\\nhowever, with increasing loan default, housing prices\\nstarted falling with a domino effect, hence the crisis.\\n3.3 market failure: poor underwriting standards\\nthe financial system was characterised by lowering\\nof underwriting standards and proliferation of credit\\nrisk transfer instruments, which were driven in part by\\nassumption of frictionless and uninterrupted liquidity.\\ncredit rating agencies out-competed one another for\\nmarket shares by issuing ratings that did not reflect the risk\\ncharacteristics of the borrowers. exploitative risk-shifting\\ntook place at every stage of the financial engineering\\nprocess. lenders collected upfront fees for originating and\\nselling poorly underwritten, and sometimes fraudulently\\ndocumented, loans and passed the risks along to investors\\nwithout accepting responsibility for subsequent defaults.\\nconsequently when the crisis was triggered by increasing\\ninterest rates, the subprime borrowers were first to declare\\ntheir inability to honour their mortgage obligations.\\n3.4 market failure: risk models’ failure\\nthere was widespread miscalculation by banks and investors\\nof the level of risk inherent in making loans to subprime\\nborrowers due to the fact that the lenders used statistical\\nmodels that were not able to differentiate different risks,\\nespecially the risk profile of subprime mortgages. not\\nsurprisingly, bad risks were given triple a ratings while in\\nactual fact they should not have been entertained at all.\\nwhen house prices began to decline between 2006 and\\n2007, mortgage delinquencies soared, and securities\\nbacked with subprime mortgages, widely held by financial\\nfirms, lost most of their value. these massive losses have\\nconsiderably impacted the balance sheets of banks across\\nthe globe, leaving them with very little capital to continue\\noperations.\\n3.5 regulatory failure\\nregulatory failure was manifested in too much faith in the\\ndiscipline of the market with high tolerance of weakening\\nunderwriting standards. mortgage lending standards by\\nfinancial institutions became lax, especially as each link\\nin the mortgage chain collected profits while believing it\\nwas passing on risk. as each player made its money, the\\nregulatory authorities pretended as if the market was\\nallocating resources efficiently; credit rating agencies were\\nthemselves unregulated in the pursuit of competition. not\\nsurprisingly, the policy makers and regulators were not able\\nto quickly bring themselves to the realization that what\\nthey religiously believed in, the power of the invisible hand,\\nwas actually strangulating the global economy.\\n2\\n4 policy responses to the crisis by the\\nindustrialised countries and g20\\ninterventionists and protectionists policies: to manage the\\nliquidity concerns and slowdown in the global economy in\\ngeneral and their respective economies in particular, the\\nauthorities in the us and many european governments\\nhave taken unprecedented steps of providing extensive\\nliquidity, giving assurances to bank depositors and creditors\\nthat include blanket guarantees, structuring bail-out\\nprograms that include taking large ownership stakes in\\nfinancial institutions, in addition to establishing programs\\nfor direct provision of credit to non-financial institutions.\\nsome countries are in the proceeds of re-introducing capital\\ncontrols as a policy of last resort in the event of extensive\\nbank runs and capital outflows. monetary policy is being\\nredefined to move away from narrowly focusing on goods\\nprices to taking into account asset price inflation, and\\nprudential regulation that recognise systemic vulnerabilities.\\nin the united states, bastion of capitalism, the federal\\nreserve announced its readiness to pump an extra $1\\ntrillion into the financial system by purchasing treasury\\nbonds and mortgage securities to bolster the economy. the\\nu.s monetary authorities (fed) have already reduced key\\npolicy interest rate nearly to zero, making the fed a buyer\\nof long-term government bonds rather than the shortterm debt that it typically buys and sells to help control\\nthe money supply. owing to the strong interventionist and\\nprotectionist policies being used to address the crisis, many\\nanalysts have declared capitalism and the mainstream policy\\nviews associated with the washington consensus, dead.\\nglobally, leaders of the group of twenty (g20) affirmed\\nat their london summit april 2009 that the only sure\\nfoundation for sustainable globalisation and rising\\nprosperity for all is an open world economy based on\\nmarket principles; effective, prudential regulation, and\\nstrong global institutions.\\nthe g20 pledged to do whatever is necessary to restore\\nconfidence, growth, and jobs; repair the financial system\\nwith improved capital adequacy guides to restore lending;\\nstrengthen financial regulation to rebuild trust; fund and\\nreform international financial institutions to overcome this\\ncrisis and prevent future ones; promote global trade and\\ninvestment and reject protectionism to underpin prosperity;\\nand build an inclusive, green, and sustainable recovery. for\\nthe developing countries such as ghana, the g20 agreed\\nto triple international monetary fund (imf) resources to\\n$750 billion; support a new special drawing rights (sdr)\\nallocation of $250 billion; support at least $100 billion of\\nadditional lending by the multilateral development banks\\n(mdbs); ensure $250 billion of support for trade finance;\\nand to use the additional resources from agreed imf gold\\nsales for concessional finance for the poorest countries. all\\nof this together will constitute an additional $1.1 trillion\\nprogramme of support to restore credit, growth and jobs in\\nthe world economy. since the financial system precipitated\\nthe global crisis, emphasis was placed on its restructuring.\\naccordingly, the g20 resolved to establish a new financial\\nstability board (fsb) with a strengthened mandate, as a\\nsuccessor to the financial stability forum (fsf), including\\nall g20 countries, fsf members, spain, and the european\\ncommission. the fsb would collaborate with the imf to\\nprovide early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks\\nand the actions needed to address them.\\ncountries are also to reshape their regulatory systems so\\nthat the authorities are able to identify and take account\\nof macro-prudential risks. similarly, measures are to be\\ntaken to extend regulation and oversight to all systemically\\nimportant financial institutions, instruments and markets\\nincluding, for the first time, systemically important hedge\\nfunds. other major recommendations are to:endorse and\\nimplement the fsf’s tough new principles on pay and\\ncompensation and to support sustainable compensation\\nschemes and the corporate social responsibility of all\\nfirms;take action, once recovery is assured, to improve the\\nquality, quantity, and international consistency of capital\\nin the banking system. in future, regulation must prevent\\nexcessive leverage and require buffers of resources to be\\nbuilt up in good times; take action against non-cooperative\\njurisdictions, including tax havens.\\nwe stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public\\nfinances and financial systems. the era of banking secrecy\\nis over. we note that the organisation of economic cooperation and development (oecd) has recently published\\na list of countries assessed by the

country\\nphenomenon; ldcs have not been at the centre, at least for\\nnow. the impact on ldcs such as ghana would be through\\nlower global growth with domino effect on developing\\ncountries’ economic performance (real gdp growth),\\ndeclining external demand for ghana’ exports, falling\\ncommodity prices, drop in remittances and higher-priced\\nfinancial flows from the international capital markets.\\n5.1 implications for real gdp growth\\nalthough the global economy and the industrialised\\neconomies have been experiencing gdp growth rates with\\nincreasing unemployment, performance of the economy\\nof ghana is still robust, and the growth trajectory that\\nemerged some five or so years ago still continues. for 2007\\nand 2008, real gdp growth rates were estimated at 6.3%\\nand 6.2%. for 2006, the growth rate was 6.2%. hence,\\nghana’s economic growth appears not to be impacted\\nadversely by the crisis to the point of derailing the growth\\ntrajectory, so far.\\n5.2 commodity prices and export performance\\nthe prices of ghana’s major exports are still holding out in\\nthe face of weakening global economic growth and falling\\nprices in manufactured products. total export earnings\\nfor 2008 were estimated at us$5,275.33 million, up by\\n26.4% from the 2007 level. cocoa exports rose from\\nus$975.7 million in 2007 to us$1,239.65 million in 2008,\\nwhich is some 67% increase. this was mainly on account\\n3\\nof increases in both volumes exported and realised export\\nprices. for gold, export earnings increased by 29.6% from\\nus$1,733.78 million in 2007 to us$2,246.25 million\\nin 2008. the growth in value was due to the combined\\neffects of price and volume as average realised prices\\nwent up by 25.8% and the volume of exports increased\\nby 4.06%. the value of exports of timber products also\\nimproved considerably to about us$309.0 million, from\\nthe us$249.0 million recorded in 2007. while average\\nprices increased by 17.64% to us$554.09 million per\\ncubic metre, the volume went up to 557,663 cubic metres,\\nwhich is an increase of 5.5%. these good performances of\\nexport earnings suggest a lagged effect of the global crisis\\non ghana’s exports or that the market is taking a flight into\\ncommodities. whichever of these options holds, ghana\\nmust start looking inwards to “domesticate” cocoa and\\ngold as linkages to the industrial sector\\n5.3 exposure of financial sector and implications for\\nghana stock exchange\\nfortunately for ghana, its financial exposure to the global\\neconomy is limited. on the part of the private sector,\\nespecially the banking system, the possible direct links to\\nthe global financial crisis by ghanaian banks continue to be\\nexposure to counterparties in the form of correspondent\\nbalances and placements with overseas banks. deposit\\nmoney banks (dmbs) correspondent balances at the end\\nof december 2008 were 55.46% of networth of banks,\\nwhich exceeds the 48.12% in 2007. these exposures are\\nwithin the internationally acceptable prudential limits. as\\nregards the ghana stock exchange, the crisis can only also\\nadversely affect it when foreign investors decide to liquidate\\ntheir shares. however, this appears not to be the case yet as\\nthe ghana stock exchange (gse) has continued to perform\\ncreditably. indeed, the bank of ghana and gse regulatory\\nframework is strong enough to pre-empt unprecedented\\nattacks on the gse to disrupt it.\\n5.4 effects on remittances\\nas massive job cuts occur in the industrialised countries,\\nghana will not remain unaffected by declining remittances.\\nremittances flows to ghana have been increasing over the\\nyears, from us$0.717billion in 2001 to us $1.83 billion\\nin 2007 and us$8.7 billion in 2008. the significance\\nof remittances in ghana’s macro-economy and microeconomy cannot be overemphasised. remittances are used\\nto shore up external reserves and manage exchange rate\\nstability. they are also micro aids to dependants, whose\\npoverty profiles would have been worse without them.\\nngos and charities, which are beneficiaries of remittances\\nhave already scaled down their activities and shed labour.\\nmany of the real estate and constructional activities taking\\nplace are from remittances. consequently, any significant\\nreductions in remittances will have adverse effects at both\\nthe macro and micro levels of the economy.\\n5.5\\t lower budgetary support through official\\n\\t development assistance\\nofficial development assistance to ghana is a critical source\\nof closing ghana’s resource gap. within the multi-donor\\nbudgetary support (mdbs) framework, the development\\npartners provide about 20% of ghana’s annual budget.\\nindeed, virtually all major capital/development projects in\\nghana are undertaken with donor assistance. any reduction\\nin donor inflows would therefore adversely affect ghana’s\\ndevelopment agenda. it is therefore heart-warming to note\\nthat the g20 has pledged some us$1.1 trillion for the imf\\nto be used in financing low income countries faced with\\nthe adverse effects of the crisis. however, it has yet to be\\nseen if this money is actually going to be disbursed; this is\\nthe critical challenge for ghana and other such developing\\ncountries.\\n5.6 implications for ghana’s chances to borrow from\\nthe international capital market\\nin 2007, ghana issued sovereign bonds to raise\\nus$750million dollars from the international capital\\nmarket. this facilitated closing of the financing 2008\\nfiscal gap. with the global crisis, access to international\\nfinancing of fiscal gap has become extremely difficult and\\non unaffordable terms. government’s attempt to raise\\nus$300 million loan from the international capital market\\nto cover debt absorbed from the 70% stake in ghana\\ntelecom sale to vodafone for $900 million was aborted\\nbecause of stringent market conditions including some\\n27% cost of credit. clearly, the resort to the international\\ncapital market to finance fiscal deficits is no longer a viable\\noption under the prevailing global crisis condition.\\n6 ghana: what to do and not to do\\nghana has been able to weather the storm so far because\\nof the limited integration of the economy in the world\\nmarket. this cannot continue especially as government’s\\ndevelopment agenda envisages export-led growth\\nstrategies, which necessarily calls for macroeconomic\\nstability.\\ngovernment would have to get more serious with\\nmacroeconomic management if investors, both foreign\\nand local, are to be attracted into the country. risk adverse\\ninvestors will increasingly discriminate against weak policies.\\nmacroeconomic stability for growth entails judicious fiscal\\nmanagement. the fiscal slippage of 15% of gdp in 2008\\nwas what engendered the acceleration of inflation and\\nexchange rate instability, which are both bad for investor\\nconfidence. monetary policy should be disinflationary and\\nshould not accommodate expansionary fiscal excesses.\\ngovernment should develop plans for adjustment to\\npotential shortfalls in external financing, especially by\\nexacting value for money on the expenditure side, and\\ncurtailing revenue leakages through administrative\\nefficiency. if ghana must go to the imf/world bank, it must\\nbe prepared with well-thought out programs underpinned\\nby strong economic arguments, just as the east-asian tigers\\ndid in their negotiation strategies.\\nthe use of cheap money policy is not a viable option for\\nnow. the industrialised countries are fighting consumption\\ndeficiency while in ghana the problem is low savings\\nwith investment deficiency. the securitisation problem\\nthat precipitated the crisis is not part of ghana’s financial\\nsuperstructure. financial stimulus or fiscal stimulus that\\ninstigates further consumption is not desirable and would\\nrather send wrong signals to investors.\\nthe regulatory authorities should learn from the policy\\nmistakes of the industrialised world; the market with\\ninvisible hand will always work but may do so at times\\n4\\nby strangulation. consequently, the regulatory and legal\\nenvironment must be strengthened to ensure that market\\nfailures are promptly dealt with.\\nbank of ghana should enhance the capacity of the deposit\\nmoney banks to develop financial products that would\\nenhance intermediation of remittances and other inflows.\\nfurthermore, the regulatory authorities and policy makers\\nmust, expeditiously, work on the removal of costs of doing\\nbusiness to the private sector to enhance private sector\\ncompetitiveness.\\ncontacts\\nfriedrich-ebert-stiftung\\np. o. box ka 9722\\naccra.\\ntel: 021 772471,\\n 761535,\\n 772687\\nfax: 021 772990\\ne-mail office@fesghana.org\\nweb:

systems. they ensure homeostasis and the viability of the human body.\\n\\nit comprises a head, hair, neck, torso (which includes the thorax and abdomen), arms and hands, legs and feet.\\n\\nthe study of the human body includes anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. the body varies anatomically in known ways. physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.\\n\\nthe body is studied by health

elements\\t\\t< 0.1\\t< 0.3\\nthe human body is composed of elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium and phosphorus. these elements reside in trillions of cells and non-cellular components of the body.\\n\\nthe adult male body is about 60% water for a total water content of some 42 litres (9.2 imp gal; 11 us gal). this is made up of about 19 litres (4.2 imp gal; 5.0 us gal) of extracellular fluid including about 3.2 litres (0.70 imp gal; 0.85 us gal) of blood plasma and about 8.4 litres (1.8 imp gal; 2.2 us gal) of interstitial fluid, and about 23 litres (5.1 imp gal; 6.1 us gal) of fluid inside cells.[1] the content, acidity and composition of the water inside and outside cells is carefully maintained. the main electrolytes in body water outside cells are sodium and chloride, whereas within cells it is potassium and other phosphates.[2]\\n\\ncells\\nsee also: list of distinct cell types in the adult human body\\nthe body contains trillions of cells, the fundamental unit of life.[3] at maturity, there are roughly 30[4]–37[5][6] trillion cells in the body, an estimate arrived at by totaling the cell numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. the body is also host to about the same number of non-human cells[4] as well as multicellular organisms which reside in the gastrointestinal tract and on the skin.[7] not all parts of the body are made from cells. cells sit in an extracellular matrix that consists of proteins such as collagen, surrounded by extracellular fluids. of the 70 kg (150 lb) weight of an average human body, nearly 25 kg (55 lb) is non-human cells or non-cellular material such as bone and connective tissue.\\n\\ngenome\\nmain article: genome\\nsee also: genetics\\ncells in the body function because of dna. dna sits within the nucleus of a cell. here, parts of dna are copied and sent to the body of the cell via rna.[8] the rna is then used to create proteins which form the basis for cells, their activity, and their products. proteins dictate cell function and gene expression, a cell is able to self-regulate by the amount of proteins produced.[9] however, not all cells have dna; some cells such as mature red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature.\\n\\ntissues\\nthe body consists of many different types of tissue, defined as cells that act with a specialised function.[10] the study of tissues is called histology and often occurs with a microscope. the body consists of four main types of tissues. these are lining cells (epithelia), connective tissue, nerve tissue and muscle tissue.[11]\\n\\ncells that lie on surfaces exposed to the outside world or gastrointestinal tract (epithelia) or internal cavities (endothelium) come in numerous shapes and forms – from single layers of flat cells, to cells with small beating hair-like cilia in the lungs, to column-like cells that line the stomach. endothelial cells are cells that line internal cavities including blood vessels and glands. lining cells regulate what can and can not pass through them, protect internal structures, and function as sensory surfaces.[11]\\n\\norgans\\nsee also: list of organs of the human body\\norgans, structured collections of cells with a specific function,[12] mostly sit within the body, with the exception of skin. examples include the heart, lungs and liver. many organs reside within cavities within the body. these cavities include the abdomen (which contains the stomach, for example) and pleura, which contains the lungs.\\n\\nheart\\nmain article: heart\\nthe heart is an organ located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs and slightly to the left. it is surrounded by the pericardium which holds it in place in the mediastinum and serves to protect it from blunt trauma, infection and help lubricate the movement of the heart via pericardial fluid.[13] the heart works by pumping blood around the body allowing oxygen, nutrients, waste, hormones and white blood cells to be transported.\\n\\n\\ndiagram of the human heart\\nthe heart is composed of two atria and two ventricles. the primary purpose of the atria is to allow uninterrupted venous blood flow to the heart during ventricular systole. this allows enough blood to get into the ventricles during atrial systole. consequently, the atria allow a cardiac output roughly 75% greater than would be possible without them.[14] the purpose of the ventricles is to pump blood to the lungs through the right ventricle and to the rest of the body through the left ventricle.[15]\\n\\nthe heart has an electrical conduction system to control the contractions and relaxation of the muscle. it starts in the sinoatrial node traveling through the atria causing them to pump blood into the ventricles. it then travels to the atrioventricular node which makes the signal slow down slightly allowing the ventricles to fill with blood before pumping it out and starting the cycle over again.[16]\\n\\ncoronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, making up 16% of all deaths.[17] it is caused by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries supplying the heart, eventually the arteries may become so narrow that not enough blood is able to reach the myocardium,[18] a condition known as myocardial infarction or heart attack, this can cause heart failure or cardiac arrest and eventually death.[19] risk factors for coronary artery disease include obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, lack of exercise and diabetes.[20] cancer can affect the heart, though it is exceedingly rare and has usually metastasized from another part of the body such as the lungs or breasts. this is because the heart cells quickly stop dividing and all growth occurs through size increase rather than cell division.[21]\\n\\ngallbladder\\nmain article: gallbladder\\nthe gallbladder is a hollow pear shaped organ located posterior to the inferior middle part of the right lobe of the liver. it is variable in shape and size. it stores bile before it is released into the small intestine via the common bile duct to help with digestion of fats. it receives bile from the liver via the cystic duct which connects to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.[22]\\n\\nthe gallbladder gets its blood supply from the cystic artery which in most people emerges from the right hepatic artery.[22]\\n\\ngallstones is a common disease in which one or more stones form in the gallbladder or biliary tract. most people are asymptomatic but if a stone blocks the biliary tract it causes a gallbladder attack, symptoms may include sudden pain in the upper right abdomen and or center of the abdomen. nausea and vomiting may also occur. typical treatment is removal of the gallbladder through a procedure called a cholecystectomy.[23][24] having gallstones is a risk factor for gallbladder cancer which although quite uncommon is rapidly fatal if not diagnosed early.[25]\\n\\nsystems\\nsee also: list of systems of the human body\\ncirculatory system\\nmain article: circulatory system\\nthe circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). the heart propels the circulation of the blood, which serves as a \"transportation system\" to transfer oxygen, fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells and signalling molecules (i.e. hormones) from one part of the body to another. paths of blood circulation within the human body can be divided into two circuits: the pulmonary circuit, which pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and leave carbon dioxide, and the systemic circuit, which carries blood from the heart off to the rest of the body. the blood consists of fluid that carries cells in the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the spleen and bone marrow.[26][27][28]\\n\\ndigestive system\\nmain article: digestive system\\n\\ndigestive system\\nthe digestive system consists of the mouth including the tongue and teeth, esophagus, stomach, (gastrointestinal tract, small and large intestines, and rectum), as well as the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and salivary glands. it converts food into small, nutritional, non-toxic molecules for distribution and absorption into the body. these molecules take the form of proteins (which are broken down into amino acids), fats, vitamins and minerals (the last of which are mainly ionic rather than molecular). after being swallowed, food moves through the gastrointestinal tract by means of peristalsis: the systematic expansion and contraction of muscles to push food from one area to the next.[29][30]\\n\\ndigestion begins in the mouth, which chews food into smaller pieces for easier digestion. then it is swallowed, and moves through the esophagus to the stomach. in the stomach, food is mixed with gastric acids to allow the extraction of nutrients. what is left is called chyme; this then moves into the small intestine, which absorbs the nutrients and water from the chyme. what remains passes on to the large intestine, where it is dried to form feces; these are then stored in the rectum until they are expelled through the anus.[30]\\n\\nendocrine system\\nmain article: endocrine system\\nthe endocrine system consists of the principal endocrine glands: the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, and gonads, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well. the endocrine hormones serve as signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, and resulting in variety of changes of function.[31]\\n\\nimmune system\\nmain article: immune system\\nthe immune system consists of the white blood cells, the thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, which are also part of the lymphatic system. the immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from outside cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as antibodies, cytokines, and toll-like receptors, among many others.[32]\\n\\n\\nskin\\nintegumentary system\\nmain article: integumentary system\\nthe integumentary system consists of the covering of the body (the skin), including hair and nails as well as other functionally important structures such as the sweat glands and sebaceous glands. the skin provides containment, structure, and protection for other organs, and serves as a major sensory interface with the outside world.[33][34]\\n\\nlymphatic system\\nmain article: lymphatic system\\nthe lymphatic system extracts, transports and metabolizes lymph, the fluid found in between cells. the lymphatic system is similar to the circulatory system in terms of both its structure and its most basic function, to carry a body fluid.[35]\\n\\nmusculoskeletal system\\nmain article: musculoskeletal system\\nthe musculoskeletal system consists of the human skeleton (which includes bones, ligaments, tendons, joints and cartilage) and attached muscles. it gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. in addition to their structural role, the larger bones in the body contain bone marrow, the site of production of blood cells. also, all bones are major storage sites for calcium and phosphate. this system can be split up into the muscular system and the skeletal system.[36]\\n\\nnervous system\\nmain article: nervous system\\n\\nnervous system\\nthe nervous system consists of the body\\'s neurons and glial cells, which together form the nerves, ganglia and gray matter which in turn form the brain and related structures. the brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory processing; it serves many aspects of communication and controls various systems and functions. the special senses consist of vision, hearing, taste, and smell. the eyes, ears, tongue, and nose gather information about the body\\'s environment.[37]\\n\\nfrom a structural perspective, the nervous system is typically subdivided into two component parts: the central nervous system (cns), composed of the brain and the spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system (pns), composed of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. the cns is mostly responsible for organizing motion, processing sensory information, thought, memory, cognition and other such functions.[38] it remains a matter of some debate whether the cns directly gives rise to consciousness.[citation needed] the peripheral nervous system (pns) is mostly responsible for gathering information with sensory neurons and directing body movements with motor neurons.[38]\\n\\nfrom a functional perspective, the nervous system is again typically divided into two component parts: the somatic nervous system (sns) and the autonomic nervous system (ans). the sns is involved in voluntary functions like speaking and sensory processes. the ans is involved in involuntary processes, such as digestion and regulating blood pressure.[39]\\n\\nthe nervous system is subject to many different diseases. in epilepsy, abnormal electrical activity in the brain can cause seizures. in multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the nerve linings, damaging the nerves\\' ability to transmit signals. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), also known as lou gehrig\\'s disease, is a motor neuron disease which gradually reduces movement in patients. there are also many other diseases of the nervous system.[38]\\n\\nreproductive system\\nmain article: human reproductive system\\n\\nthis section may require cleanup to meet wikipedia\\'s quality standards. the specific problem is: should be cut down more to fit the length of the other systems, and some paragraphs are a bit difficult to read. please help improve this section if you can. (june 2023) (learn how and when to remove this template message)\\nthe primary purpose of the reproductive system is to produce new humans in the form of children and ensure their sexual development so that they can produce new humans too. it is composed of the gonads (testicles and ovaries) which produce eggs and sperm cells (gametes) and produce hormones necessary for proper sexual development. the rest of the glands and ducts of the reproductive system are responsible for the transportation and sustaining of the gametes and to nurture the offspring.[40]\\n\\nthe reproductive system is first stimulated by the hypothalamus during puberty which causes the ovaries and testicles to produce testosterone (male) and estrogen and progesterone (female). male puberty generally occurs between the ages of 13 and 15 and is characterized by beginning of sperm production and the development of secondary sex characteristics such as increased height and weight, broadened shoulders, pubic and facial hair, voice deepening and muscle development. female puberty generally occurs between the ages of 9 and 13 and is characterized by ovulation and menstruation. the growth of secondary sex characteristics, such as growth of pubic and underarm hair, breast, uterine and vaginal growth, widening hips and increased height and weight, also occur during the female puberty process.[41]\\n\\nthe external male reproductive system is made up of the penis and the scrotum which is a sac containing the testicles. the penis consists of the glans, and contains the urethra and urinary meatus – the point where urine exits the penis. the rest of the penis is called the shaft and contains most of the urethra. the glans is covered by a fold of skin called the foreskin, although this can be removed through circumcision.[41]\\n\\n\\ninternal gross anatomy of the male reproductive system\\ninternally, the male reproductive system starts in the testes where hundreds of seminiferous tubules produce sperm which is then stored and matured into spermatozoon in the epididymis. they are then brought through the vas deferens which leads away from the testes to the seminal vesicles where the sperm cells are mixed with a fructose-rich fluid from the seminal vesicles allowing the sperm to stay alive and remain healthy. it is then brought by the ejaculatory duct through the prostate and bulbourethral gland, and mixed with fluids from said glands. the fluid from the prostate helps to neutralize the acidity of the vagina and keep the sperm alive. this mixture of sperm and accessory gland fluids is called semen and is released through the urethra during ejaculation. almost the entire internal male reproductive system works in pairs with two testes, two epididymis, two vas deferens, two seminal vesicles, two ejaculatory ducts, two bulbourethral glands, but only one prostate and urethra.[41][42]\\n\\n\\nexternal female reproductive system with mons pubis highlighted\\nthe external female reproductive system, also called the vulva, consists of the mons pubis, a fatty mass that covers the pubis, the labia majora (outer lips), the labia minora (inner lips), the vaginal opening which opens into the vagina and is where the penis is inserted during sexual intercourse and children are born. the urethral opening is for the urethra that carries urine from the bladder and the clitoris which contains the most sensitive nerve endings and in humans has no use other than sexual pleasure. located between the anus and vulva is the perineum.[43][41]\\n\\n\\ninternal gross anatomy of the female reproductive system\\ninternally, the female reproductive system contains two ovaries, the uterus, two fallopian tubes and the cervix. at birth, a female has about 700,000 oocytes (the immature version of the egg cell) in both ovaries combined, although this degenerates to about 400,000 by the time puberty is reached. this is a lifetime supply, as after birth, no more oocytes are produced, compared to males where sperm cells are produced during their entire lifetime. during puberty, the menstrual cycle begins for the first time, in response to low estrogen and progesterone levels the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh). this causes the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh). fsh stimulates ovarian follicles to grow and one dominant follicle will eventually take over.\\n\\nas the ovarian follicle continues to grow, it releases more estradiol which stimulates lh secretion and suppresses fsh secretion, preventing further follicular growth. when lh levels are highest, the follicle ruptures releasing the ovum in a process called ovulation where it is then moved to one of the fallopian tubes. after ovulation, the portion of the follicle that remains in the ovary is transformed into a corpus luteum which continues to produce estrogen and high levels of progesterone. the progesterone causes the endometrium to grow thick, preparing it for implantation of a fertilized egg. if fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum continues to secrete hormones until the placenta develops enough to secrete the necessary hormones for maintaining pregnancy. eventually, the corpus luteum will turn into a corpus albicans which is essentially scar tissue. if fertilization fails, the corpus luteum will degrade into the corpus albicans and stop secreting enough progesterone and estrogen, causing the endometrial lining to break resulting in menstruation.[41][44]\\n\\nmany diseases affect the reproductive system such as polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) which is characterized by elevated androgen levels, menstrual irregularities and/or small cysts on one or both of the ovaries. it is a common disease affecting at least 7% of adult women. symptoms may include excess body hair, infertility, or weight gain, male pattern baldness.[45][46]\\n\\nanother reproductive disease is testicular torsion, it occurs when the spermatic cord which holds up the testicle wraps around itself cutting off blood flow to the testicle. testicular torsion is a medical emergency and can result in testicular death or infertility if not treated immediately by physically unwrapping the spermatic cord. if the testicle has suffered severe damage, it may need to be surgically in a lateral orchiectomy. the primary symptom of testicular torsion is severe testicular pain at rest, nausea and vomiting may also occur. testicular torsion can occur at any age, although it is most common in 12-18 year olds.[47][48]\\n\\nsexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, hiv, chlamydia, hpv and genital warts are spread through sexual intercourse, including oral, vaginal and anal sex. many of these infections can be lethal if left untreated though others are mostly harmless.[49][50]\\n\\ncancer can affect many parts of the reproductive system including the penis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, cervix, vagina, fallopian, uterus and vulva.[51]\\n\\nrespiratory system\\nmain article: respiratory system\\nthe respiratory system consists of the nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs. it brings oxygen from the air and excretes carbon dioxide and water back into the air. first, air is pulled through the trachea into the lungs by the diaphragm pushing down, which creates a vacuum. air is briefly stored inside small sacs known as alveoli (sing.: alveolus) before being expelled from the lungs when the diaphragm contracts again. each alveolus is surrounded by capillaries carrying deoxygenated blood, which absorbs oxygen out of the air and into the bloodstream.[52][53]\\n\\nfor the respiratory system to function properly, there need to be as few impediments as possible to the movement of air within the lungs. inflammation of the lungs and excess mucus are common sources of breathing difficulties.[53] in asthma, the respiratory system is persistently inflamed, causing wheezing and/or shortness of breath. pneumonia occurs through infection of the alveoli, and may be caused by tuberculosis. emphysema, commonly a result of smoking, is caused by damage to connections between the alveoli.[54]\\n\\nurinary system\\nmain article: urinary system\\n\\nfemale urinary system\\nthe urinary system consists of the two kidneys, two ureters, bladder, and urethra. it removes waste materials from the blood through urine, which carries a variety of waste molecules and excess ions and water out of the body.\\n\\nfirst, the kidneys filter the blood through their respective nephrons, removing waste products like urea, creatinine and maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes and turning the waste products into urine by combining them with water from the blood.[55] the kidneys filter about 150 quarts (170 liters) of blood daily, but most of it is returned to the blood stream with only 1-2 quarts (1-2 liters) ending up as urine.[56] the urine is brought by the ureters from the kidneys down to the bladder.\\n\\nthe smooth muscle lining the ureter walls continuously tighten and relax through a process called peristalsis to force urine away from the kidneys and down into the bladder. small amounts of urine are released into the bladder every 10–15 seconds.\\n\\nthe bladder is a hollow balloon shaped organ located in the pelvis. it stores urine until the brain signals it to relax the urinary sphincter and release the urine into the urethra starting urination.[57] a normal bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (half a liter) for 3–5 hours comfortably.\\n\\nnumerous diseases affect the urinary system including kidney stones which are formed when materials in the urine concentrate enough to form a solid mass, urinary tract infections which are infections of the urinary tract and can cause pain when urinating, frequent urination and even death if left untreated. renal failure occurs when the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste from the blood and can lead to death if not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation.[58] cancer can affect the bladder, kidneys, urethra and ureters with the latter two being far more rare.[59]\\n\\nanatomy\\nmain articles: outline of human anatomy and anatomy\\n\\ncavities of human body\\nhuman anatomy is the study of the shape and form of the human body. the human body has four limbs (two arms and two legs), a head and a neck which connect to the torso. the body\\'s shape is determined by a strong skeleton made of bone and cartilage, surrounded by fat (adipose tissue), muscle, connective tissue, organs, and other structures. the spine at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible vertebral column which surrounds the spinal cord, which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the brain to the rest of the body. nerves connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. all major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of anatomical variations such as sesamoid bones and accessory muscles.\\n\\nblood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the heart. venules and veins collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. these collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body\\'s two largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which drain blood into the right side of the heart. from here, the blood is pumped into the lungs where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. from here, it is pumped into the body\\'s largest artery, the aorta, and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. here blood passes from small arteries into capillaries, then small veins and the process begins again. blood carries oxygen, waste products, and hormones from one place in the body to another. blood is filtered at the kidneys and liver.\\n\\nthe body consists of a number of body cavities, separated areas which house different organ systems. the brain and central nervous system reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the blood brain barrier. the lungs sit in the pleural cavity. the intestines, liver, and spleen sit in the abdominal cavity.\\n\\nheight, weight, shape and other body proportions vary individually and with age and sex. body shape is influenced by the distribution of bones, muscle and fat tissue.[60]\\n\\nphysiology\\nmain articles: outline of physiology and physiology\\nhuman physiology is the study of how the human body functions. this includes the mechanical, physical, bioelectrical, and biochemical functions of humans in good health, from organs to the cells of which they are composed. the human body consists of many interacting systems of organs. these interact to maintain homeostasis, keeping the body in a stable state with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.[61]\\n\\neach system contributes to homeostasis, of itself, other systems, and the entire body. some combined systems are referred to by joint names. for example, the nervous system and the endocrine system operate together as the neuroendocrine system. the nervous system receives information from the body, and transmits this to the brain via nerve impulses and neurotransmitters. at the same time, the endocrine system releases hormones, such as to help regulate blood pressure and volume. together, these systems regulate the internal environment of the body, maintaining blood flow, posture, energy supply, temperature, and acid balance (ph).[61]\\n\\ndevelopment\\nmain article: development of the human body\\n\\nbaby being carried\\ndevelopment of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. the process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by sperm. the egg then lodges in the uterus, where an embryo and later fetus develop until birth. growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. development and growth continue throughout life, through childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood to old age, and are referred to as the process of aging.\\n\\nsociety and culture\\nprofessional study\\nfurther information: history of anatomy, history of medicine, and history of physiology\\n\\nanatomical study by leonardo da vinci\\nhealth professionals learn about the human body from illustrations, models, and demonstrations. medical and dental students in addition gain practical experience, for example by dissection of cadavers. human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry are basic medical sciences, generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.[62][63][64]\\n\\ndepiction\\nmain article: depictions of nudity\\n\\nfigure drawing by lovis corinth (before 1925)\\nin western societies, the contexts for depictions of the human body include information, art and pornography. information includes both science and education, such as anatomical drawings. any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes.[65] the most contentious disputes are between fine art and erotic images, which define the legal distinction of which images are permitted or prohibited.\\n\\nhistory of anatomy\\nmain article: history of anatomy\\n\\ntwo facing pages of text with woodcuts of naked male and female figures, in the epitome by andreas vesalius, 1543\\nin ancient greece, the hippocratic corpus described the anatomy of the skeleton and muscles.[66] the 2nd century physician galen of pergamum compiled classical knowledge of anatomy into a text that was used throughout the middle ages.[67] in the renaissance, andreas vesalius (1514–1564) pioneered the modern study of human anatomy by dissection, writing the influential book de humani corporis fabrica.[68][69] anatomy advanced further with the invention of the microscope and the study of the cellular structure of tissues and organs.[70] modern anatomy uses techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging to study the body in unprecedented detail.[71]\\n\\nhistory of physiology\\nmain article: history of physiology\\nthe study of human physiology began with hippocrates in ancient greece, around 420 bce, and with aristotle (384–322 bce) who applied critical thinking and emphasis on the relationship between structure and function. galen (c.\\u2009126 – c.\\u2009199) was the first to use experiments to probe the body\\'s functions.[72] the term physiology was introduced by the french physician jean fernel (1497–1558). in the 17th century, william harvey (1578–1657) described the circulatory system, pioneering the combination of close observation with careful experiment.[73] in the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate with the cell theory of matthias schleiden and theodor schwann in 1838, that organisms are made up of cells. claude bernard (1813–1878) created the concept of the milieu interieur (internal environment), which walter cannon (1871–1945) later said was regulated to a steady state in homeostasis. in the 20th century, the physiologists knut schmidt-nielsen and george bartholomew extended their studies to comparative physiology and ecophysiology.[74] most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.[75]\\n\\nsee also\\nicon\\tbiology portal\\nicon\\tmedicine portal\\nanatomical model – three-dimensional representation of human or animal anatomy\\nbody image –
